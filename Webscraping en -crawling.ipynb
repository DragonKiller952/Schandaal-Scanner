Dit geeft een gemakkelijke en legale manier om links op te kunnen halen voor webscraping. Als gekeken wordt naar de top 10 resultaten wanneer zelf wordt gezocht tegenover de Google API, produceert het resultaten die 20% verschillen[1], maar aangezien het scrapen van data op search engines beperkt is en niet toegestaan is binnen hun gebruiksovereenkomst is het gebruiken van API's de optimale manier om data te verzamelen.[2]\n",

      " Freddie Mercury(bornFarrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock bandQueen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octavevocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen. Born in 1946 inZanzibartoParsi-Indianparents, Mercury attended British boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled theZanzibar Revolution, moving toMiddlesex, England. Having previously studied and written music, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitaristBrian Mayand drummerRoger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985Live Aidconcert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury was diagnosed withAIDSin 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and was posthumously featured on their final album,Made in Heaven(1995). In 1991, the day after publicly announcing his diagnosis,he diedfrom  complications of the disease at the age of 45. In 1992,a concert in tribute to himwas held atWembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 2001, theSongwriters Hall of Famein 2003, and theUK Music Hall of Famein 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members received theBrit AwardforOutstanding Contribution to British Music. One year after his death, Mercury received the same award individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded anIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in theBBC's poll of the100 Greatest Britons. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara inStone Townin theBritish protectorateofZanzibar(now part ofTanzania) on 5 September 1946.[2][3]His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara,[a][4]were from theParsicommunity of western India. The Bulsaras had origins in the city of Bulsar (nowValsad) inGujarat.[b][2]He had a younger sister, Kashmira (b. 1952).[5][6][7] The family had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at theBritish Colonial Office. As Parsis, the Bulsaras practisedZoroastrianism.[8]Mercury was born with fourextra incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range.[9][10]As Zanzibar was a British protectorate until 1963, Mercury was born aBritish subject, and on 2 June 1969 was registered acitizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesafter the family had emigrated to England.[11] Mercury spent most of his childhood in India where he began taking piano lessons at the age of seven while living with relatives.[12]In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study atSt. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, inPanchganinearBombay.[13]Inheriting his father's interest inphilately, between 9 and 12 years old Mercury collected stamps, many of which were from the British Commonwealth.[14]One of the rare personal possessions of Mercury in museum ownership, his stamp album is displayed in the collection of thePostal Museumin London.[14]At the age of 12, he formed a school band,the Hectics, and coveredrock and rollartists such asCliff RichardandLittle Richard.[15][16]One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said \"the only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music\".[17]A friend recalls that he had \"an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano\".[18]It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself \"Freddie\". In February 1963, he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.[19] In the spring of 1964, Mercury and his family fled to England from Zanzibar to escape the violence of therevolutionagainst theSultan of Zanzibarand his mainly Arab government,[20]in which thousands of ethnic Arabs and Indians were killed.[21]They moved to 19 Hamilton Close,Feltham,Middlesex, a town 13 miles (21 km) west of central London. The Bulsaras briefly relocated to 122 Hamilton Road, before settling into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue in late October.[22]After first studying art atIsleworth PolytechnicinWest London, Mercury studied graphic art and design atEaling Art College, graduating with a diploma in 1969.[23]He later used these skills to design heraldic arms for his band Queen.[24] Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand Edwardian clothes and scarves inKensington Marketin London withRoger Taylor. Taylor recalls, \"Back then, I didn't really know him as a singer—he was just my mate. My crazy mate! If there was fun to be had, Freddie and I were usually involved.\"[25]He also held a job as a baggage handler atHeathrow Airport.[26]Other friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man with a great interest in music.[27]In 1969, he joinedLiverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage, which played \"veryHendrix-style, heavy blues\".[28]He briefly lived in a flat above the Dovedale Towers, a pub onPenny Lanein Liverpool'sMossley Hilldistrict.[29][30]When this band failed to take off, he joined anOxford-based band,Sour Milk Sea, but by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.[31] In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitaristBrian Mayand drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their bandSmile.[23]They were joined by bassistJohn Deaconin 1971. Despite the reservations of the other members andTrident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name \"Queen\" for the new band. He later said, \"It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.\"[32]At about the same time, he legallychanged his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.[33] Shortly before the release of Queen'sself-titled first album, Mercury designed the band's logo, known as the \"Queen crest\".[24]The logo combines thezodiacsigns of the four band members: two lions for Deacon and Taylor (signLeo), a crab for May (Cancer), and two fairies for Mercury (Virgo).[24]The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.[24]A crown is shown inside the Q, and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormousphoenix. The Queen crest bears a passing resemblance to theRoyal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.[24] Although Mercury's speaking voice naturally fell in thebaritonerange, he delivered most songs in thetenorrange.[34]His known vocal range extended frombasslow F (F2) tosopranohigh F (F6).[35]He couldbeltup totenorhigh F (F5).[35]BiographerDavid Bretdescribed his voice as \"escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfectcoloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches\".[36]SpanishsopranoMontserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that \"the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice\".[37]She adds: His technique was astonishing. No problem oftempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.[35] The Wholead singerRoger Daltreydescribed Mercury as \"the best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that's an art. And he was brilliant at it.\"[38]Discussing what type of person he wanted to play thelead rolein his musicalJesus Christ Superstar,Andrew Lloyd Webbersaid: \"He has to be of enormous charisma, but he also has to be a genuine, genuine rock tenor. That's what it is. Really think Freddie Mercury, I mean that's the kind of range we're talking about.\"[39] A research team undertook a study in 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice.[40]Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably fastervibratoand use ofsubharmonicsas unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers.[41]The research team studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, and a series of interviews of the late artist. They also used anendoscopicvideo camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.[41][42] Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen'sGreatest Hitsalbum: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Bicycle Race\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\", \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", and \"Play the Game\".[43]In 2003 Mercury was posthumously inducted into theSongwriters Hall of Famewith the rest of Queen, and in 2005 all four band members were awarded anIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[44][45] The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles,rockabilly,progressive rock,heavy metal,gospel, anddisco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, \"I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things.\"[46]Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is non-cyclical in structure and comprises dozens ofchords.[47][48]He also wrote six songs fromQueen IIwhich deal with multiple key changes and complex material. \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Although Mercury often wrote very intricateharmonies, he said that he could barely read music.[49]He composed most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of key signatures.[47] Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd.[50]A writer forThe Spectatordescribed him as \"a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself.\"[51]David Bowie, who performed at theFreddie Mercury Tribute Concertand recorded the song \"Under Pressure\" with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: \"Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest ... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.\"[52]Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make \"the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected\".[53]Mercury's main prop on stage was a brokenmicrophone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless ways.[54] One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took place atLive Aidin 1985.[23]Queen's performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music. The results were aired on a television program called \"The World's Greatest Gigs\".[55][56]Mercury's powerful, sustained note during thea cappellasection came to be known as \"The Note Heard Round the World\".[57][58]In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, \"Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots toMick Jagger,Robert Plant, etc. all are guilty of a terrible oversight. Freddie, as evidenced by hisDionysianLive Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all.\"[59]PhotographerDenis O'Regan, who captured a definitive pose of Mercury on stage—arched back, knee bent and facing toward the sky—during his final tour with Queen in 1986, commented \"Freddie was a once-in-a-lifetime showman\".[60]Queen roadie Peter Hince states, \"It wasn't just about his voice but the way he commanded the stage. For him it was all about interacting with the audience and knowing how to get them on his side. And he gave everything in every show.\"[50] Throughout his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved.[46]He once explained, \"We're theCecil B. DeMilleof rock and roll, always wanting to do things bigger and better.\"[46]The band was the first ever to play in South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in theMorumbi Stadiumin São Paulo in 1981.[61]In 1986, Queen also played behind theIron Curtainwhen they performed to a crowd of 80,000 inBudapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe.[62]Mercury'sfinal live performancewith Queen took place on 9 August 1986 atKnebworth Parkin England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 200,000.[63]A week prior to Knebworth, May recalled Mercury saying \"I'm not going to be doing this forever. This is probably the last time.\"[63]With the British national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" playing at the end of the concert, Mercury's final act on stage saw him draped in a robe, holding a golden crown aloft, bidding farewell to the crowd.[64][65] As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time werethe Who,the Beatles,Jimi Hendrix,David Bowie, andLed Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. Brian May said that Mercury \"had a wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him like nobody else – incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling.\"[66]KeyboardistRick Wakemanpraised Mercury's playing style, saying he \"discovered [the piano] for himself\" and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument.[67]From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlistedFred Mandel(a Canadian musician who also worked forPink Floyd,Elton John, andSupertramp) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg),[68]and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated withMike Moran(in the studio) andSpike Edney(in concert).[69] Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Somebody to Love\", and \"Don't Stop Me Now\". He used concertgrand pianos(such as aBechstein) and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as theharpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Brian May said that Mercury used the piano less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience.[70][71]Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.[72] As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of theUK Music Charts. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonymLarry Lurex, whenTrident Studios' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs \"I Can Hear Music\" and \"Goin' Back\", both were released together as a single in 1973.[1]Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927Fritz LangfilmMetropolis. The song\"Love Kills\"was written for the film byGiorgio Moroderin collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder andMack; in 1984 it debuted at the number 10 position in theUK Singles Chart.[73] I won't be touring on my own or splitting up with Queen. Without the others I would be nothing. The press always makes out that I'm the wild one and they're all quiet, but it's not true. I've got some wild stories about Brian May you wouldn't believe. Mercury's two full albums outside the band wereMr. Bad Guy(1985) andBarcelona(1988).[23]His first album,Mr. Bad Guy, debuted in the top ten of theUK Album Charts.[73]In 1993, a remix of \"Living on My Own\", a single from the album,posthumously reached number oneon theUK Singles Charts. The song also garnered Mercury a posthumousIvor Novello Awardfrom theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.[75]AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describesMr. Bad Guyas \"outstanding from start to finish\" and expressed his view that Mercury \"did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory\".[76] His second album,Barcelona, recorded with SpanishsopranovocalistMontserrat Caballé, combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as \"the most bizarre CD of the year\".[77]The album was a commercial success,[78]and thealbum's title trackdebuted at No. 8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain.[79]The title track received massive airplay as the official anthem of the1992 Summer Olympics(held inBarcelonaone year after Mercury's death). Caballé sang it live at the opening of the Olympics with Mercury's part played on a screen, and again before the start of the1999 UEFA Champions League FinalbetweenManchester UnitedandBayern Munichin Barcelona.[80] In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own version of the hit \"The Great Pretender\" bythe Platters, which debuted at No. 5 in the UK in 1987.[73]In September 2006 a compilation album featuring Mercury's solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his 60th birthday. The album debuted in the UK top 10.[81]In 2012,Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender, a documentary film directed byRhys Thomason Mercury's attempts to forge a solo career, premiered onBBC One.[82] In 1986, Mercury recorded two songs forDave Clark'sWest Endsci-fi musicalTime. Mercury performedthe title songand Clark played it toLaurence Olivierwho starred as the hologram Akash in a pre-filmed segment for the musical in what was one of his last roles, with Clark recalling: \"Laurence Olivier was a huge god of an actor. He narrated the album [Time], and, when Freddie came on, singing \"Time\", Olivier said, 'Now, my dear boy,there'san actor.'\" Clark relayed the reaction of Olivier to Mercury: \"I told Freddie and he was over the moon. I arranged for a dinner party at my place, Olivier came along and they got on like a house on fire.\"[83] Between 1981 and 1983 Mercury recorded several tracks withMichael Jackson, including a demo of \"State of Shock\", \"Victory\", and \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\".[84][85]None of these collaborations were officially released at the time, althoughbootlegrecordings exist. Jackson went on to record the single \"State of Shock\" withMick Jaggerforthe Jacksons' albumVictory.[86]Mercury included the solo version of \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\" on hisMr. Bad Guyalbum.[87]\"There Must Be More to Life Than This\" was eventually reworked by Queen and released on their compilation albumQueen Foreverin 2014.[88]Mercury andRoger Taylorsang on the title track forBilly Squier's 1982 studio release,Emotions in Motionand later contributed to two tracks on Squier's 1986 release,Enough Is Enough, providing vocals on \"Love is the Hero\" and musical arrangements on \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\".[89]In 2020, Mercury's music video for \"Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\" was nominated for Best Animation at theBerlin Music Video Awards. Woodlock studio is behind the animation.[90] In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. Austin, born inFulham, London, met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 and he was 23 years old, a year before Queen had formed.[91]He lived with Austin for several years inWest Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive atElektra Records. In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship.[69]Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, and bought Austin a place of her own near his new address of 12 Stafford Terrace, Kensington.[92] Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years; Mercury often referred to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, he said of Austin: \"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was mycommon-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.\"[93]Mercury's final home,Garden Lodge, an 8-bedroomGeorgianmansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, was picked out by Austin.[94]Austin married the painting artist Piers Cameron; they have two children. Mercury was the godfather of her older son, Richard.[70]In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, having told her, \"You would have been my wife, and it would have been yours anyway.\"[95] From 1979 to 1985, while living inMunich, Mercury was friends with Austrian actressBarbara Valentin, who is featured in the video for \"It's a Hard Life\", and initially lived together with her and her daughter before moving into his own apartment.[96][97]In Munich, Mercury was able to escape the media spotlight, lived out his sexuality, drifted in the local gay scene, and had an intense love relationship with German restaurateur Winfried \"Winnie\" Kirchberger.[96][98][99]Mercury also lived temporarily at Kirchberger's apartment[100]and thanked him \"for board and lodging\" in the liner notes of his 1985 albumMr. Bad Guy.[101]He wore a silver wedding band given to him by Kirchberger.[102]A close friend described him as Mercury's \"great love\" in Germany.[103] By 1985, he began another long-term relationship, with Irish-born hairdresser Jim Hutton (1949–2010) whom he referred to as his husband.[104]Mercury described their relationship as one built on solace and understanding, and said that he \"honestly couldn't ask for better\".[105]Hutton, who testedHIV-positivein 1990, lived with Mercury for the last seven years of his life, nursed him during his illness, and was present at his bedside when he died. Mercury wore a gold wedding band, given to him by Hutton in 1986, until the end of his life. He was cremated with it on.[102]Hutton later relocated from London to the bungalow he and Mercury had built for themselves in Ireland.[102] Radio disc jockeyKenny Everettmet Mercury in 1974, when he invited the singer onto hisCapital Londonbreakfast show.[106]As two of Britain's most flamboyant, outrageous and popular entertainers, they shared much in common and became close friends.[106]In 1975, Mercury visited Everett, bringing with him an advance copy of the single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[94]Despite doubting that any station would play the six-minute track, Everett placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, exclaimed: \"Forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries\".[94]Although Capital Radio had not officially accepted the song, Everett talked incessantly about a record he possessed but could not play. He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: \"Oops, my finger must've slipped.\"[94]On one occasion, Everett aired the song fourteen times over a single weekend.[107]Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.[106][108] During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett's confidant.[106]Throughout the early-to-mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and use drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together.[106]By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wifeLee Everett Alkin.[106]In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.[106] Mercury saw the stage version of the London musicalThe Rocky Horror Showat theRoyal Court TheatreinChelsea, and in 1975 went to see thefilm version, both of which starredTim Curry. Curry and Mercury became friends, and as a keen horticulturalist Curry later told the UK edition ofHouse And Gardenmagazine about designing Mercury's garden: \"Freddie came back from a tour and said, 'The garden, dear, it's dead.' I said, 'What? Did you water it?' And Freddie said, 'Water it, dear?'\"[109]Both Mercury and Curry were also close friends withPeter Straker; Straker, who first met Mercury at a London restaurant in November 1975, was a frequent diner at Mercury's home in Garden Lodge.[110] Mercury was a long-time friend ofElton John. Shortly before his own death in November 1991, Mercury ordered that a watercolour by John's favourite artist, the 19th-century English impressionist painterHenry Scott Tuke, be given to John on Christmas Day. In a 2021 interview, John recalled: \"Here was this beautiful man, dying from AIDS, and in his final days, he had somehow managed to find me a lovely Christmas present\".[111] While some commentators said Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,[20][37][112]others said he was \"openlygay\".[113][114]In December 1974, when asked directly, \"So how about being bent?\" by theNew Musical Express, Mercury replied, \"You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further.\"[115]Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had beendecriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, seven years earlier. During public events in the 1980s, Mercury often kept a distance from his partner, Jim Hutton.[116] Mercury's flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance atWembley Arenain 1984 forKerrang!, noted Mercury's \"camp\" addresses to the audience and even described him as a \"posing, pouting, posturing tart\".[117]In 1992, John Marshall ofGay Timesopined: \"[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' ... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement.\"[118]In an article forAfterElton, Robert Urban said: \"Mercury did not ally himself to 'politicaloutness,' or toLGBTQcauses.\"[118] Some believe Mercury was bisexual; for example, regarding the creation ofCelebrate Bisexuality Day,Wendy Currysaid: \"We were sitting around at one of the annual bi conventions, venting and someone – I think it wasGigi– said we should have a party. We all loved the great bisexual, Freddie Mercury. His birthday was in September, so why not Sept? We wanted a weekend day to ensure the most people would do something. Gigi's birthday was September 23rd. It fell on a weekend day, so, poof! We had a day.\"[119][120]The Advocatesaid in May 2018, \"Closetedthroughout his life, Mercury, who was bisexual, engaged in affairs with men but referred to a woman he loved in his youth, Mary Austin, as 'the love of his life,' according to the biographySomebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury.\"[121]Additionally, according to an obituary Mercury was a \"self-confessed bisexual\".[122][123] The 2018 biopic of Mercury,Bohemian Rhapsody, received criticism for its portrayal of Mercury's sexuality, which was described as \"sterilized\" and \"confused\", and was even accused of being \"dangerous\".[124][125][126] Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well,[18][37]and granted very few interviews. He once said of himself: \"When I'm performing I'm anextrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man.\"[127]On this contrast to \"his larger-than-life stage persona\", BBC music broadcasterBob Harrisadds he was \"lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable.\"[128]While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience.NirvanafrontmanKurt Cobain's suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury \"seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd\".[129][130] Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, \"that's something inbred, it's a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persianpopinjay\",[131]an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background. Feeling a connection to Britain prior to arriving in England, the young Bulsara was heavily influenced by British fashion and music trends while growing up.[131]According to his longtime assistant Peter Freestone, \"if Freddie had his way, he would have been born aged 18 inFeltham.\"[131]Harris states, \"One of the things about Freddie was that he was very civilised and quite 'English'. I'd go over to his flat nearShepherd's Bushin the afternoon, and he'd get out the fine china and the sugar lumps and we'd have a cup of tea.\"[128]His flamboyant dress sense and the emergence ofglam rockin the UK in the early 1970s saw Mercury wear outfits designed byZandra Rhodes.[132] When asked byMelody Makerin 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, \"Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few.John Lennonwas one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people's thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between. People with mere talent, like me, have not got the ability or power.\"[133]Mercury dedicated a song to the former member ofthe Beatles. The song, \"Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)\", is included in the 1982 albumHot Space.[134]Mercury did occasionally express his concerns about the state of the world in his lyrics. His most notable \"message\" songs are \"Under Pressure\", \"Is This the World We Created...?\" (a song which Mercury and May performed at Live Aid, and also featured inGreenpeace – The Album), \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\", \"The Miracle\" (a song May called \"one of Freddie's most beautiful creations\") and \"Innuendo\".[135][136] Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from theBlue Cross. Mercury \"placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life\", and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them. Mercury wrote a song for Delilah, \"his favourite cat of all\", which appeared on the Queen albumInnuendo.[137]Mercury dedicated his liner notes in his 1985 solo albumMr. Bad Guyto Jerry and his other cats. It reads, \"This album is dedicated to my cat Jerry—also Tom, Oscar, and Tiffany and all the cat lovers across the universe—screw everybody else!\"[138] In 1987, Mercury celebrated his 41st birthday at thePikes Hotel,Ibiza, Spain, several months after discovering that he had contracted HIV.[94]Mercury sought much comfort at the retreat and was a close friend of the owner, Anthony Pike, who described Mercury as \"the most beautiful person I've ever met in my life. So entertaining and generous.\"[139]According to biographerLesley-Ann Jones, Mercury \"felt very much at home there. He played some tennis, lounged by the pool, and ventured out to the odd gay club or bar at night.\"[110]The birthday party, held on 5 September 1987, has been described as \"the most incredible example of excess the Mediterranean island had ever seen\", and was attended by some 700 people.[140]A cake in the shape ofAntoni Gaudi'sSagrada Famíliawas provided for the party. The original cake collapsed and was replaced with a two-metre-long sponge cake decorated with the notes from Mercury's song \"Barcelona\".[139]The bill, which included 232 broken glasses, was presented to Queen's manager,Jim Beach.[141]Before his death, Mercury had told Beach, \"You can do what you want with my music, but don't make me boring.\"[142] Mercury exhibitedHIV/AIDSsymptoms as early as 1982. Authors Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne have stated in their biographical book about Mercury,Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury, that Mercury secretly visited a doctor in New York City to get a white lesion on his tongue checked (which might have beenhairy leukoplakia, one of the first signs of an infection) a few weeks before Queen's final American appearance with Mercury onSaturday Night Liveon 25 September 1982, where he began to exhibit the symptoms of someone recently infected with HIV.[143] In October 1986, two months after Mercury's final live performance with Queen atKnebworth Houseon theMagic Tour, the British newspapers theNews of the WorldandThe Sunreported that Mercury had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at aHarley Streetclinic, but he was quoted as saying he was \"perfectly fit and healthy\".[145]According to his partner, Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late April 1987.[146]Around that time, Mercury said in an interview that he had tested negative for HIV.[37] The British press pursued rumours about Mercury's health over the next few years, fuelled by his increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring, and reports from his former lovers totabloid journalists. By 1990, rumours about Mercury's health were rife.[147]At the1990 Brit Awardsheld at theDominion Theatre, London, on 18 February, Mercury made his final appearance on stage, when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.[148][149] Mercury and his inner circle of colleagues and friends continually denied the stories. It has been suggested that Mercury could have helped AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his illness.[52][150]Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him; May later confirmed that Mercury had informed the band of his illness much earlier.[151][152]Filmed in May 1991, themusic videofor \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" features a very thin Mercury in his final scenes in front of the camera.[153]Director of the videoRudi Dolezalcomments, \"AIDS was never a topic. We never discussed it. He didn't want to talk about it. Most of the people didn't even 100 percent know if he had it, apart from the band and a few people in the inner circle. He always said, 'I don't want to put any burden on other people by telling them my tragedy.'\"[154]The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May said of Mercury: \"He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really.\"[144]Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, said: \"This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [Freddie] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [of his illness] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.'\"[144] After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home inKensington, West London. His former partner, Mary Austin, was a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last few weeks made regular visits to look after him.[155]Near the end of his life, Mercury began to lose his sight, and declined so that he was unable to leave his bed.[155]Mercury chose to hasten his death byrefusing medication and took only painkillers.[155]On 22 November 1991, Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach to his Kensington home to prepare a public statement, which was released the following day:[151] Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with me, my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue. On the evening of 24 November 1991, about 24 hours after issuing the statement, Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington.[156]The cause of death wasbronchial pneumoniaresulting from AIDS.[157]His close friendDave Clarkofthe Dave Clark Fivewas at the bedside vigil when Mercury died.[158]Austin phoned Mercury's parents and sister to break the news, which reached newspaper and television crews in the early hours of 25 November.[159] Mercury's funeral service was conducted on 27 November 1991 by aZoroastrianpriest atWest London Crematorium, where he is commemorated by aplinthunder his birth name. In attendance at Mercury's service were his family and 35 of his close friends, includingElton Johnand the members of Queen.[160][161]His coffin was carried into the chapel to the sounds of \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\"/\"You've Got a Friend\" byAretha Franklin.[162]In accordance with Mercury's wishes, Mary Austin took possession of hiscremated remainsand buried them in an undisclosed location.[71]The whereabouts of his ashes are believed to be known only to Austin, who has said that she will never reveal them.[163]However, they are traditionally held by Queen fans to beKensal Green Cemetery, where the plinth marks the supposed burial location.[164] Mercury spent and donated to charity much of his wealth during his lifetime, with his estate valued around £8 million at the time of his death. He bequeathed his home, Garden Lodge, and the adjoining Mews, as well as a 50% of all privately owned shares, to Mary Austin. His sister, Kashmira Cooke, received 25%, as did his parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, which Cooke acquired upon their deaths. He willed £500,000 to Joe Fannelli; £500,000 to Jim Hutton; £500,000 to Peter Freestone; and £100,000 to Terry Giddings.[165]Mercury, who never drove a car because he had no licence, was often chauffeured around London in hisRolls-Royce Silver Shadowfrom 1979 until his death. The car was passed to his sister Kashmira who made it available for display at public events, including the West End premiere of the musicalWe Will Rock Youin 2002, before it was auctioned off at theNECin Birmingham in 2013 for £74,600.[166][167] Following his death, the outer walls of Garden Lodge inLogan Placebecame a shrine to Mercury, with mourners paying tribute by covering the walls in graffiti messages.[168]Three years laterTime Outmagazine reported that \"the wall outside the house has become London's biggest rock 'n' roll shrine\".[168]Fans continued to visit to pay their respects with letters appearing on the walls[169]until 2017, when Austin had the wall cleared.[170]Hutton was involved in a 2000 biography of Mercury,Freddie Mercury, the Untold Story, and also gave an interview forThe Timesin September 2006 for what would have been Mercury's 60th birthday.[146] The charisma and power in his performance style has over the years led to many artists quoting him as one of their biggest inspirations today. The diverse scope of artists that love Mercury is huge. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music,[172][173]Mercury was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octavevocal range.[174][175][176]He defied the conventions of a rock frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.[177] The extent to which Mercury's death may have enhanced Queen's popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen's popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death.[178]In 1992, one American critic noted, \"What cynics call the 'dead star' factor had come into play—Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence.\"[179]The movieWayne's World, which featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", also came out in 1992.[180]According to theRecording Industry Association of America, Queen had sold 34.5 million albums in the United States by 2004, about half of which had been sold since Mercury's death in 1991.[181] Estimates of Queen's total worldwide record sales to date have been set as high as 300 million.[182]In the United Kingdom, Queen have now spent more collective weeks on theUK Album Chartsthan any other musical act (includingthe Beatles),[183]andQueen's Greatest Hitsis thebest-selling albumof all time in the United Kingdom.[184]Two of Mercury's songs, \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", have also each been voted as the greatest song of all time in major polls bySony Ericsson[185]andGuinness World Records.[186]Both songs have been inducted into theGrammy Hall of Fame; \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in 2004 and \"We Are the Champions\" in 2009.[187]In October 2007 the video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was voted the greatest of all time by readers ofQmagazine.[188] Since his death, Queen were inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 2001, and all four band members were inducted into theSongwriters Hall of Famein 2003.[189][190]Their Rock Hall of Fame citation reads, \"in the golden era ofglam rockand gorgeously hyper-produced theatrical extravaganzas that defined one branch of '70s rock, no group came close in either concept or execution to Queen.\"[191]The band were among the inaugural inductees into theUK Music Hall of Famein 2004. Mercury was individually posthumously awarded theBrit Awardfor Outstanding Contribution to British Music in 1992.[192]They received theIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authorsin 2005, and in 2018 they were presented theGrammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[45][193] In November 1995, Mercury appeared posthumously on Queen's final studio albumMade in Heaven.[23][194]The album featured Mercury's previously unreleased final recordings from 1991, as well as outtakes from previous years and reworked versions of solo works by the other members.[195]The album cover features the Freddie Mercury statue that overlooks Lake Geneva superimposed with Mercury's Duck House lake cabin that he had rented. This is where he had written and recorded his last songs atMountain Studios.[195]The sleeve of the album contains the words, \"Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury.\"[195] Featuring tracks such as \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\", the album also contains the song \"Mother Love\", the last vocal recording Mercury made before his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor, and Deacon later added the instrumental track.[196]After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he \"wasn't feeling that great\" and stated, \"I will finish it when I come back next time\". He never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.[144] A statue in Montreux, Switzerland, by sculptorIrena Sedlecká, was erected as a tribute to Mercury.[197]It stands almost 10 feet (3.0 metres) high overlooking Lake Geneva and was unveiled on 25 November 1996 by Mercury's father and Montserrat Caballé, with bandmates Brian May and Roger Taylor also in attendance.[198]Beginning in 2003 fans from around the world have gathered in Switzerland annually to pay tribute to the singer as part of the \"Freddie Mercury Montreux Memorial Day\" on the first weekend of September.[199] In 1997 the three remaining members of Queen released \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\", a song dedicated to Mercury and all those that die too soon.[200]In 1999 aRoyal Mailstamp with an image ofMercury on stagewas issued in his honour as part of the UK postal service'sMillennium Stampseries.[201][202]In 2009 a star commemorating Mercury was unveiled inFeltham, west London where his family moved upon arriving in England in 1964.

      "The late Queen singer and Mary Austin were romantically linked for nearly a decade Dave Hogan/Getty Freddie Mercury’s former fiancée, Mary Austin, remained one of his closest friends until his death. The iconicQueenfrontman met Austin in 1969, a year before the band formed. After dating for a few years, they got engaged in 1973, but it didn't last. Mercury broke it off three years later, according to theNew York Post. Though they ended their romantic relationship, Mercury and Austin stayed in each other's lives untilhis death from AIDS-related complicationsin 1991 — and the two loved each other as if they were married. “All my lovers asked me why they couldn’t replace Mary, but it’s simply impossible,” Mercury said in a 1985 interview. “The only friend I’ve got is Mary, and I don’t want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that’s enough for me.” After his death, Mercury left Austin the majority of his fortune, as well as his mansion in Kensington and all of his possessions — which she kept for over 30 years before selling everything in recent years. Their relationship was also depicted in the 2018 biopic,Bohemian Rhapsody, starringRami Malekas Mercury andLucy Boyntonas Austin. So where is Mary Austin Now? Here’s everything to know about her friendship with Freddie Mercury and what she’s doing today. Rogers/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Like Mercury — whose parents were a court cashier and a homemaker in Zanzibar — Austin grew up in a working class family in Battersea, South London. Both of her parents were deaf and communicated through sign language, while her dad worked as a wallpaper trimmer and her mom as a domestic helper, according to theDaily Mail. After meeting Mercury in 1969, Austin with in a relationship with the artist for about seven years before he came out to her as bisexual. Dave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty Austin met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 while working at the clothing store Biba in Kensington, West London, she recalled in the 2000 documentaryFreddie Mercury: The Untold Story. At the time, Mercury — then 24 years old — and future Queen drummerRoger Taylorwere running a clothing stall in Kensington Market, where Mercury and Austin first encountered each other. It was a year before Queen formed in 1970, but Austin immediately saw Mercury’s uniqueness. In a conversation with theDaily Mail, she described him as a “wild-looking artistic musician.” “He was like no one I had met before. He was very confident – something I have never been,\" she added. \"We grew together. I liked him and it went on from there.\" The couple fell in love and moved into a shared apartment on Holland Road in London. Dave Hogan/Getty Mercury and Austin's romantic relationship was short-lived, but their friendship spanned decades. A few years after the couple started dating, Mercury proposed to Austin on Christmas Day in 1973. She told theDaily Mailthat although they were happy together, the proposal was a complete surprise. “I looked at it and was speechless. I remember thinking, ‘I don’t understand what’s going on,’ ” Austin told the outlet. “It wasn’t what I’d expected at all. So I asked him, ‘Which hand should I put this on?’ And he said, ‘Ring finger, left hand.’ ” After a few years, Mercury called off the engagement, and their physical relationship deteriorated. Austin suspected something was wrong, as Mercury wasn't behaving like himself. She believed it was because he was cheating on her, but she realized what was going on when Mercury came out to her in 1976. “It was a relief actually to hear it from him,” Austin said inFreddie Mercury: The Untold Story. “I felt like a huge burden had been lifted. Once that had been discussed, he was like the person I’d known in the early years.” Despite their romantic involvement ending, the two didn't completely separate from each other. Over time, Austin moved in and out ofMercury’s Kensington mansion— nicknamed Garden Lodge, which he bought in 1980. They lived together for two decades until Mercury died. “We lived those 20-odd years together. Under the same roof. Together emotionally,” Austin told theDaily Mailin 2013. Austin was at the Kensington home with Mercury during his final days while he suffered from health complications due to hisAIDS diagnosis— which he received four years earlier in 1987. Austin was devastated after Mercury’s death. “I lost my family, really, when Freddie died,” she told the publication. “He was everything to me.” Dave Hogan/Getty When Mercury died at 45 on Nov. 22, 1991, Austin was given his home, possessions and a financial stake in Queen. The singer left his 28-room Kensington mansion to Austin — includingall of his belongingsinside of it — and the majority of his fortune. Austin told theDaily Mailthat she viewed the responsibility of the house and the money as overwhelming. “I found myself thinking, ‘Oh Freddie, you’ve left me too much and too much to deal with as well.’ I felt I couldn’t live up to it,” she recounted. Despite the difficulties, Austin lived in Mercury’s mansion for over 30 years until she put the house on the market in February 2024. Steve Wood/Mirrorpix via Getty After Mercury’s death, Austin continued living in their shared Kensington mansion, surrounded by different mementos that reminded her of the late singer. In February 2024, Austin decided to list the property for sale, asking for offers “in excess of” 30 million pounds (approximately $38 million). In a statement shared with PEOPLE, Austin described the home as “the most glorious memory box” filled with “love and warmth in every room” — as the home remained mostly exactly how Mercury left it. “It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here,” she said. “Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist’s house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person.” The house is not publicly listed, and it’s unclear whether it has sold since it was put on the market. Austin also listed the majority of Mercury’s possessions — aside from a few “personal gifts” and photos of the two together — for auction in 2023. TheSotheby’s auctionincluded 1,400 of the singer’s possessions, including a Yahama grand piano and a silver Tiffany & Co. mustache comb, which went for $189,000. The items were first held in a month-long exhibition titled “Freddie Mercury: A World of His Own,” before being sold over six days of auctioning. In a Sotheby’s release, Austin spoke abouther decision to sell Mercury’s items. “I hope this will be an opportunity to share all the many facets of Freddie, both public and private, and for the world to understand more about, and celebrate, his unique and beautiful spirit,\" she explained in part. Dave Benett/Getty Over the years, Austin has maintained a private life. She has two adult sons who also keep their lives out of the public eye. Austin welcomed them with ex-husband painter Piers Cameron in the early 1990s. She was later briefly married to businessman Nick Holford, which ended in divorce. In the years since Mercury’s death, Austin has spoken about how she continues to remember him. “I miss the fun, the humor, his warmth, his energy,” she toldthe BBCin 2023.

      "The life of Frederick Bulsara began on the East African island of Zanzibar on September 5, 1946. 25 years later in London under the name of Freddie Mercury he was fronting the now legendary rock group named Queen. The son of Bomi and Jer Bulsara, Freddie spent the bulk of his childhood in India where he attended St. Peter’s boarding school. He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. No one could foresee where a love of music would take him. The Bulsara family moved to Middlesex in 1964 and from there Freddie joined up with a blues band called Wreckage while studying graphic design courses at Ealing College of Art. While singing for Wreckage, a fellow student introduced Freddie to Roger Taylor and Brian May, founder members of a band called Smile. Smile metamorphosed into Queen when Freddie joined Roger and Brian as the lead vocalist. The final member of the band, which was to stay together for the next 20 years, was bassist John Deacon, who joined the band on 1st of March 1971. The rest is rock history. EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their debut album ‘Queen’ was released and hailed as one of the most exciting developments ever in rock music. The immortal operatically styled single ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ was released in 1975 and proceeded to the top of the UK charts for 9 weeks. A song that was nearly never released due to its length and unusual style but which Freddie insisted would be played became the instantly recognisable hit. By this time Freddie’s unique talents were becoming clear, a voice with a remarkable range and a stage presence that gave Queen its colourful, unpredictable and flamboyant personality. Very soon Queen’s popularity extended beyond the shores of the UK as they charted and triumphed around Europe, Japan and the USA where in 1979 they topped the charts with Freddie’s song ‘Crazy Little Thing Called Love’. Queen was always indisputably run as a democratic organisation. All four members are each responsible for having penned number one singles for the band. This massive writing strength combined with spectacular lights, the faultless sound, a sprinkling of theatricality and Freddie’s balletic movements made up Queen on stage and on film. Through Freddie’s ability to project himself and the band’s music and image to the four corners of 70,000 seater venues they became known as the prime developers of stadium rock, a reputation perpetuated by their pioneering tactics in South America where in 1981 they performed to 231,000 fans in Sao Paulo, a world record at the time. They also became known as the key innovators of pop videos as their catalogue of 3-minute clips became more and more adventurous in style, size and content. Their phenomenal success continued around the globe throughout the 80’s highlighted in 1985 by their show-stealing and unforgettable performance on stage at Live Aid. In the mid 80’s, Freddie started concentrating on his solo career, which was to run in tandem with Queen (“the mothership”) for several albums commencing with the 1985 release of ‘Mr. Bad Guy’. Freddie’s much loved sense of self-parody reached a zenith with his cover version of The Platter’s song ‘The Great Pretender’ in 1987, the video of which recorded him descending a sweeping staircase among acres of identical cardboard cutouts of himself. His first major collaboration outside Queen was with Dave Clark for the recording of London’s West End musical Time, in 1986. This was followed in 1987 with the realisation of one of Freddie’s long-term dreams; to record with the world revered opera diva Montserrat Caballé. The LP’s title song, ‘Barcelona’ went on to become an anthem for Señora Caballé’s home city and the theme for the Olympics in 1992. While most publicly recognised as the front man to one of the most progressive rock bands of the 70’s, Freddie defied the stereotype.  A taste for venturing into new territories – a trait that was to have a marked influence on the direction Queen would take – took Freddie to explore his interests in a wide spectrum of the arts, particularly in the areas of ballet, opera and theatre, even taking a participating role:  in  October1977 the sell-out audience of a charity gala at the London Coliseum organised by Royal Ballet Principal dance Wayne Eagling received the surprise of an unannounced appearance by a silver-sequinned leotard-clad Freddie performing an intricate routine choreographed for him by Eagling.  In 1987 he made a one-night appearance in Dave Clarke’s Time at the Dominion Theatre, although legend has it Freddie occasionally turned up at the theatre to support friend Clarke’s musical, one night selling ice-creams in the stalls!  Freddie would have loved the fact that The Dominion now plays host to the band’s phenomenally successful musical We Will Rock You which has now held the Dominion stage nearly seven years longer than Time’s two year run. Freddie returned to the studios to record ‘Innuendo’ with Queen in 1990. On November 24th, 1991, Freddie’s struggle against AIDS ended when he passed away just over 24 hours after he had publicly announced he had the disease. Musicians and fans from all over the world paid their highest respects as the passing of rock’s most innovative, flamboyant ambassador signified the end of an era at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium on April 20, 1992 which gave birth to the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the AIDS charity set up in Freddie’s memory by the remaining members of Queen and Freddie’s Executor, Jim Beach. Freddie Mercury, who majored in stardom while giving new meaning to the word showmanship, left a legacy of songs, which will never lose their stature as classics to live on forever. Some of the most poignant of these were immortalised on the Queen album ‘Made In Heaven’ released in November 1995. The sleeve of the album shows a view from Freddie’s Montreux home. Despite twenty years having passed since Freddie lost his life to HIV complications, he remains in the minds of millions throughout the world as one of the greatest artists we will ever see. In September 2010 (coincidentally, around Freddie's 64th birthday) a poll carried out among rock fans saw him named the Greatest Rock Legend Of All Time, beating Elvis Presley to claim the title, and ahead of David Bowie, Jon Bon Jovi, Jimi Hendrix and Ozzy Osbourne. September 5, 2010 saw The Mercury Phoenix Trust launch ‘Freddie For A Day’, a major annual initiative designed to celebrate Freddie’s life each year on his birthday and to support the on-going work of the Trust.  The project encourages fans to dress as Freddie for a day and in doing so raise funds for MPT through sponsorship.  No one could have imagined the extraordinary response which resulted, with fans from 24 countries around the world, from Argentina to Ukraine, seizing on the idea to pay their own special tribute to Freddie. Some sent pictures strutting their stuff at home, singing into a microphone in their bedroom. Others took the plunge and spent the whole day as Freddie, including one US enthusiast who dressed herself as ‘Slightly Mad’ Freddie and then spent her day at the local mall and then at Columbus Zoo in Ohio with a penguin and a gorilla. Another took a TGV trip from France to Switzerland dressed in a harlequin leotard. The stories of extraordinary and fun days spent come in their hundreds, and as a result, Freddie For A Day is now an annual event. Taking it one stage further, Freddie’s 65th birthday, September 5, 2011 was celebrated with a major party in London in aid of The Mercury Phoenix Trust, hosted by Queen’s Brian May and Roger Taylor. A major Hollywood movie about Freddie and Queen, produced by GK Films, Robert de Niro’s Tribeca Productions and Queen Films is expected to start shooting shortly. Freddie Mercury would have been 70 this September and as part of the celebrations a Mercury Phoenix Trust produced fan party will be held in his honour near Lake Geneva, Montreux.

Mercury tenía una hermana menor, Kashmira Cooke.[12]​ A los cinco años empezó a asistir al colegio misionero de Zanzíbar, regentado por monjas anglicanas, aunque la religión familiar continuaba siendo el zoroastrismo.[13]​ El 4 de febrero de 1954, a los siete años de edad, fue enviado con su abuela y su tía Sheroo Khory a estudiar al St. Peter's School,[14]​ uninternadode estilo británico para niños en Pachgani, cerca deBombay, en la India.[15]​ Aquí fue donde empezó a ser más conocido como Freddie, sobrenombre que también adoptó su familia.[9]​ El talento musical de Bulsara fue observado por el decano del St. Peter College, quien escribió una carta a sus padres, sugiriendo que, con el aumento de la cuota mensual, Freddie podría tomar más clases de música.[16]​ Con la aprobación de Bomi y Jer, Freddie alcanzó el cuarto nivel de aprendizaje depiano.[16]​ Durante su permanencia en la universidad, también tuvo sus primeras experiencias musicales, formando junto a cuatro compañeros The Hectics,[b]​ una banda que actuaba en fiestas o eventos escolares y en la que Freddie era el pianista, tocando canciones deCliff Richard,Little Richard[17]​ y deBuddy Holly.[18]​ Un amigo suyo de aquella época decía que el cantante tenía «una increíble habilidad para escuchar la radio y reproducir las melodías al piano».[19]​ Terminó su educación en St. Mary's School, en Bombay.[20]​ Tras haber regresado a Zanzíbar en 1964, a la edad de dieciocho años, la familia tuvo que mudarse a Inglaterra a causa de larevolución de Zanzíbar, que estaba socavando la estabilidad política del país, revuelta que dio lugar al nacimiento del estado deTanzania.[21]​[22]​ Así, se establecieron en una pequeña casa enFeltham, enMiddlesex, cerca delaeropuerto de Heathrow, enLondres.[23]​ Freddie continuó su educación en la escuela politécnica deIsleworth(desde 1993 College West Thames); además de sus estudios de arte, en sus primeros años ingleses trabajó en un servicio de cáterin cerca del aeropuerto y en un almacén en la zona comercial en Feltham.[16]​ En la primavera de 1966, obtuvo las notas más altas en el examen de arte del Politécnico Isleworth, puntuación que le permitió su entrada en la Escuela de Arte Ealing deLondres,[16]​ donde estudió arte y diseño gráfico, al establecerse en el barrio deKensingtonen un apartamento, alquilado por un amigo.[24]​ Paralelamente a sus estudios, Freddie trabajó en una tienda de ropa en Kensington Market, junto a su pareja del momento, Mary Austin,[25]​[26]​ y escribió algunos artículos breves para periódicos londinenses.Tim Staffell, compañero de clase en Ealing, era cantante y bajista deSmile, banda en la que también estaban el guitarristaBrian Mayy el bateristaRoger Taylor; Staffell intentó, en un primer momento, convencer a Bulsara para que se uniera al grupo como segundo cantante, pero sin éxito.[9]​ Poco después de recibir su diploma en la Escuela de Arte Ealing, Bulsara se unió a Ibex, una banda deLiverpoolcon influencias deCream.[27]​ Pocos días después de la primera reunión con el grupo, Freddie había aprendido de memoria todas las canciones del repertorio del grupo. Su primera actuación en público como cantante se llevó a cabo en Bolton el 23 de agosto de 1969.[16]​ Dos días más tarde, Ibex realizó un concierto al aire libre en el Queen's Park de Bolton;[27]​ como consecuencia de esto, los miembros de la banda regresaron a Londres y comenzaron a trabajar en algunas canciones con el nuevo cantante. Este fue un período económicamente difícil, tanto para la banda de Bulsara como para Smile. Los músicos pasaban juntos la mayor parte del tiempo en pequeños apartamentos, a veces durmiendo en el suelo y tocando su música hasta altas horas de la noche.[28]​ Tanto Bulsara como Roger Taylor trabajaron como vendedores en Kensington Market.[c]​La última aparición oficial de Ibex fue el 9 de septiembre de 1969 enThe Sink, un pequeño club de Liverpool, ciudad donde esa misma noche, los miembros de Smile estaban tocando en otro club. Según algunos biógrafos, Taylor y May invitaron a Bulsara a subir al escenario para tocar algunas de sus canciones.[27]​ En el último mes de 1969, el nombre de Ibex cambió a Wreckage, porque su cantante, Mike Smith, se había ido a Estados Unidos. En el grupo permanecieron Mike Bersin y «Tup» Taylor, junto a Bulsara,[30]​ quien compuso numerosas canciones, entre ellas «Stone Cold Crazy».[31]​ Sin embargo, ninguna de las canciones, a excepción de una pista llamada «Green», tuvo el éxito esperado, y el grupo se disolvió.[32]​ Freddie Bulsara comenzó de nuevo a buscar un nuevo grupo y respondió a un anuncio de la bandaSour Milk Seapublicado en el semanarioMelody Maker. Los miembros del grupo quedaron impresionados por su voz y lo contrataron para actuar tres noches a la semana.[27]​ Escasos meses después, el grupo decidió separarse por diferencias creativas.[27]​ Su primer sencillo de Smile, «Earth/Step On Me», grabado en losTrident Studiosy publicado en mayo de 1969 por Mercury Records, fue lanzado en losEstados Unidossin obtener todavía el éxito esperado. Staffell decidió dejar Smile porque le interesaba tomar otra dirección con respecto a su música.[33]​ May y Taylor contactaron entonces con Bulsara, quien se unió a ellos como solista en abril de 1970.[34]​ Como él propuso, optaron porQueencomo nuevo nombre de la banda. Luego diría sobre esto: «Yo era consciente de las connotacionesgay, pero eso es solo una faceta del nombre».[35]​ Al mismo tiempo, también cambió su apellido artístico de Bulsara a Mercury, debido a que, según sus propias palabras, en la canción «My Fairy King», en el verso «Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me»,[d]​ cantaba sobre su propia madre. Consideraba que el nombre «Freddie Mercury» tenía «fuerza».[36]​[37]​ El 27 de junio de 1970, conoció a Mary Austin, con quien vivió durante siete años.[16]​ Los tres, junto al bajista Mike Grose, se presentaron por primera vez en público, enTruro, en un concierto a beneficio de laCruz Roja.[31]​ La formación definitiva se completó en 1971 conJohn Deacon, año en el que Mercury y el resto del grupo, con el propósito de ganar más confianza sobre el escenario, afrontaron su primera gira enCornualles.[31]​ En 1972, Mercury, gracias a sus estudios dediseño gráfico, creó el logo de Queen, a partir delEscudo de Armas Real del Reino Unido, incluyendo en el logotipo lossignos del Zodiacode los cuatro miembros de la banda.[38]​[39]​ Al año siguiente lanzaron el primer álbum de la banda,Queen, con canciones grabadas anteriormente en De Lane Lea Studios. Antes del lanzamiento del disco, Mercury lanzó el sencillo «I Can Hear Music» y «Goin' Back», respectivamente,versionesde canciones deThe RonettesyDusty Springfield, con el seudónimo deLarry Lurex.[31]​ A principios de los años setenta, Freddie Mercury comenzó a tener su primera toma de conciencia de su orientación sexual, expresada durante una entrevista en diciembre de 1974 a la revistaNew Musical Express, donde declaró que era «gay como un narciso».[40]​ Durante esos años, Mercury usó ropa de la diseñadoraZandra Rhodes, además de llevar el cabello largo y las uñas pintadas.[9]​ A lo largo de la década, Mercury tuvo una relación prolongada con Mary Austin, a quien conoció gracias a Brian May, y vivió con ella muchos años en West Kensington. También tuvo un encuentro amoroso con un ejecutivo de la compañíaElektra Records, lo que acabó con la relación que tenía con ella.[41]​ Mercury y Austin mantuvieron una cercana amistad a lo largo de los años y el cantante se refería a ella como su única amiga de verdad. En una entrevista de 1985, afirmó: «Todos mis amantes me preguntan por qué no puedo reemplazar a Mary Austin, pero eso es sencillamente imposible. La única amiga que tengo es Mary y no quiero a nadie más. Para mí, ella es como una esposa. Para mí era como un matrimonio. Confiamos el uno en el otro, eso me basta».[42]​ Escribió muchas canciones sobre Austin, entre las cuales se destaca «Love of My Life». Mercury fue además el padrino del hijo mayor de Austin, Richard.[43]​ Conforme avanzaba la década, Mercury empezó a cortarse más y más el volumen y largo de su cabello y también comenzó a dejar de lado sus vestuarios de la época glam. Ya para 1978 tenía el cabello a la altura del cuello y comenzó a vestirse de variadas formas. Para la giraJazz Touradoptó la extraña costumbre, sobre todo para cantar «We Will Rock You», de subirse a los hombros de una persona disfrazada deSuperman(que en esos años tuvo un renacer como personaje gracias a las películas protagonizadas porChristopher Reeve),[44]​ que sostenía a Mercury mientras cantaba. Otro disfraz que empleaba era el del antagonista de la primera trilogía deStar Wars,Darth Vader. Sin embargo, Mercury tuvo que dejar el uso del personaje deStar Warspor enfrentamientos conGeorge Lucas.[45]​ A principios de la década de los ochenta, Freddie presentó su nuevo aspecto en la portada de «Play the Game», ya que se cortó el cabello y dejó crecer su bigote.[47]​[48]​ La adopción del bigote coincidió con el aspecto arquetípico de los homosexuales masculinos de principios de los ochenta conocido como estiloCastro clon, por elbarriohomónimo en San Francisco.[49]​[50]​ El estilo de su pelo y su bigote también cambió con los años. Al principio Freddie tuvo el cabello espeso al igual que su bigote, luego empezó a bajar el volumen de su pelo y comenzó a peinarlo más al ras de su cabeza, así como hacer más fino su bigote. Ya para 1987 se afeitó su característico bigote.[51]​[52]​ Luego de realizar labanda musical deFlash Gordon(1980), Queen lanzóHot Space(1982), que dio mayor cabida a los temas bailables, además de que la banda quiso capitalizar el sonido del exitoso sencillo «Another One Bites the Dust» de 1980. El álbum fue número 4 en las listas del Reino Unido y disco de oro, al igual que en Estados Unidos, destacándose «Under Pressure», realizado con un encomiado dueto conDavid Bowie.[53]​ Por esos años Queen yMichael Jacksoncoincidieron en estudio y Mercury se hizo amigo de Jackson, y grabaron dos temas. Pese a la química inicial, Jackson y Mercury se distanciaron por las costumbres de cada uno de ellos que no compatibilizaban con sus respectivas personalidades. Mercury dijo de Jackson, por ejemplo, que era demasiado excéntrico para él y su estilo de vida.[54]​[55]​[56]​ En 1984, Queen lanzó su decimoprimer álbum,The Works (álbum)y al año siguiente participó en el concierto benéficoLive Aid, organizado porBob Geldofpara recaudar fondos contra el hambre que asolabaEtiopíapor aquellos años.[57]​ pero desde 1983 sus integrantes se habían dedicado más a sus respectivas carreras en solitario que a su proyecto como grupo, aunque siguieron en contacto.[58]​ Durante algo más de veinte minutos dieron el que está considerado el mejor concierto en directo de la historia delrock, y tocaron canciones como «We Are the Champions», «Crazy Little Thing Called Love» y «Radio Ga Ga», entre otras.[59]​[60]​ Queen fue la principal atracción de la primera edición del festival Rock in Rio, celebrado en Río de Janeiro en 1985, actuando en dos noches ante un público combinado de unas 600 000 personas. El comportamiento de Freddie Mercury fue criticado en los bastidores. Freddie no quiso interacción con los artistas brasileños y destrozó el camerino después del concierto.[61]​ Hacia 1985, Mercury inició otra relación de larga duración con un peluquero llamado Jim Hutton, quien sería diagnosticado deVIHen 1990 y viviría con Mercury los últimos seis años de la vida de este.[62]​ Hutton admitió que tardó un año en dar la noticia de su diagnóstico a Mercury.[63]​ Hutton falleció decáncer de pulmónel 1 de enero de 2010.[64]​ Al año siguiente de empezar la relación, en 1986, Freddie Mercury se embarcó, con Queen, en la giraMagic Tour, que consistió en veintiséis conciertos en Europa.[65]​ A su paso por Madrid, Freddie Mercury y el resto de la banda concedieron una entrevista al programa de TVEInforme semanal. En ella, Freddie mostró su devoción por la soprano españolaMontserrat Caballé. En palabras de Mercury, ella era «una superdiva». Desde el nombramiento de Barcelona como próxima ciudad olímpica en el año 1986, la soprano había iniciado una campaña para promocionar su ciudad, y en este contexto cobraba sentido colaborar con una estrella del rock reconocida internacionalmente.[66]​ Se encontraron en marzo de 1987 en elHotel Ritzde Barcelona.[67]​ Decidieron hacer una canción juntos, y luego hicieron un álbum entero:Barcelona. Mercury y Caballé forjaron una gran amistad.[68]​[69]​ Dieron dos conciertos en directo: el primero enIbiza, en la discoteca Ku; el segundo en La Nit, en octubre de 1988, en Barcelona. Además de su trabajo con Queen, Mercury grabó dos álbumes como solista y lanzó muchos sencillos. Pese a que sus trabajos no fueron tan comercialmente exitosos como sus álbumes con Queen, algunos de ellos debutaron entrando en eltop10 de laslistas británicas.[70]​ Los álbumes de Freddie Mercury como solista fueronMr. Bad Guy(1985) yBarcelona(1988). El primero tiene un estilo basado en la músicapopydisco.Barcelona, por el contrario, fue grabado junto a la cantante de óperaMontserrat Caballé, a quien admiraba profundamente.[71]​Mr. Bad Guyfiguró, en su lanzamiento, en el décimo puesto en las listas de venta del Reino Unido.[70]​ En 1993, una versiónremezcladade «Living on My Own», un sencillo del primero de sus álbumes, alcanzó el puesto número uno en laUK Singles Chart.[70]​ La canción hizo además que Mercury ganara un premioIvor Novellopóstumo. El crítico deAllmusicEduardo Rivadavia describió aMr. Bad Guycomo «impresionante desde el principio hasta el final», y expresó que Mercury «hizo un considerable trabajo de exploración en tierras desconocidas».[72]​ Tras escuchar a la cantante de óperaMontserrat Caballéen Nueva York, Mercury pidió un encuentro con ella. El mismo tuvo lugar en marzo de 1987 en el Hotel Ritz de Barcelona. En esa primera reunión, en la que se profesaron admiración mutua, ella le preguntó «Querido, ¿compondrías una canción para mi ciudad?» y se pusieron de acuerdo para grabar un disco juntos.[73]​ Al domingo siguiente, con Mercury entre la audiencia, Caballé incluyó el tema «Exercises in Free Love» (una de las canciones que Freddie había cantando junto a ella en su primer encuentro) en el bis de su recital en elCovent Gardende Londres. El álbum tardó nueve meses en grabarse.Barcelonacombina elementos de la música popular con la ópera. Algunos críticos calificaron el trabajo como «el CD más extravagante del año».[74]​ Caballé, por su parte, consideró al álbum como uno de los mejores éxitos de su carrera.El sencillo que lleva el nombre del álbumse ubicó en el momento de su lanzamiento en el octavo puesto en las listas de sencillos británicas y fue todo un éxito en España,[71]​[75]​ donde el tema se convirtió en la canción promocional de lasOlimpiadas de 1992, celebradas enBarcelonaun año después de la muerte del cantante, y tras lo cual el tema subió hasta la segunda posición de las listas, cinco años después de su publicación.[76]​[77]​ Además, Caballé lo interpretó en la final de laUEFA Champions Leaguede 1999, disputada en Barcelona.[71]​ Además de sus dos álbumes como solista, Mercury lanzó muchos otros sencillos, como «Love Kills» (1984), «In My Defence» (1986), «Time» (1986), o su propia versión de la canción «The Great Pretender» (1987), que llegó al cuarto puesto en el Reino Unido.[70]​ Tras su muerte, se lanzó en 1992 el álbum recopilatorioThe Freddie Mercury Album(llamado en Estados UnidosThe Great Pretender). En el año 2000, se publicó elbox setThe Solo Collection.Que recopilaba toda su carrera en solitario, incluidos sus discos solistas, colaboraciones y todo tipo de singularidades, como entrevistas y su obra previa a Queen. Cuando se daba a conocer comoLarry Lurex. En septiembre de 2006, se lanzó el álbum recopilatorioLover of Life, Singer of Songs, que incluía algunos trabajos de Mercury como solista. En conmemoración del 60.º aniversario de su nacimiento. Y enEstados Unidosen noviembre, casi coincidiendo con el 15.º aniversario de su fallecimiento. El disco ocupó el sexto lugar en las listas de venta en el Reino Unido.[78]​ De niño, Mercury escuchaba música hindú, y una de sus primeras influencias fue la cantanteLata Mangeshkar, a quien tuvo la oportunidad de ver en directo en la India.[79]​ Después de mudarse a Inglaterra, Mercury se hizo fanático dePink Floyd,Aretha Franklin,The Who,Jim Croce,Bob Dylan,Elvis Presley,Led Zeppelin,The Rolling Stones,Jimi Hendrix,Cliff RichardyThe Beatles.[80]​ Otro de los artistas favoritos de Mercury era la cantante y actrizLiza Minnelli. Una vez explicó: «Una de mis primeras inspiraciones surgió deCabaret. Adoro a Liza Minnelli. La forma en la que canta, la pura energía».[81]​ Pese a que la voz de Mercury al hablar se hallaba en elregistrodebarítono, usualmente cantaba en elregistrodetenor.[82]​ Un crítico describió su voz diciendo que «[en] la escala de algunos compases va de un gruñido tiporockgutural a tierno y vibrante tenor, y luego a un tono de alta coloratura, perfecta, pura y cristalina en la parte aguda».[83]​ En 2015 un grupo de científicos de múltiples nacionalidades de la Logopedics Phoniatrics Vocology publicó un estudio que concluía que Freddie tenía una voz distintiva y muy excepcional.[84]​ Era capaz de emplear subarmónicas, técnica que pocas personas pueden emplear incluso al hablar.[85]​[7]​[86]​ El estudio sugiere también que Mercury redujo el registro de su voz cuando cantó ópera por temor a que sus admiradores no la reconocieran.[87]​ LasopranoespañolaMontserrat Caballé, a quien conoció en elHotel RitzdeBarcelonay con quien Mercury grabó un álbum,[71]​ expresó su opinión diciendo que «la diferencia entre Freddie y la mayoría de las estrellas derockes que él vendía la voz».[88]​ A medida que la carrera de Queen iba progresando, Mercury reemplazaba las notas más agudas de las canciones que interpretaba en directo cantándolas en otras octavas más graves. Padecía denódulos vocalesy dijo que nunca había tomado clases de canto.[89]​ Mercury escribió diez de las diecisiete canciones incluidas en el álbumGreatest Hits: «Bohemian Rhapsody», «Seven Seas of Rhye», «Killer Queen», «Somebody to Love», «Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy», «We Are the Champions», «Bicycle Race», «Don't Stop Me Now», «Crazy Little Thing Called Love» y «Play the Game».[88]​ También participó como compositor en ocho de los diecisiete temas delGreatest Hits II: «Under Pressure» (junto al resto de Queen yDavid Bowie),[90]​ «Innuendo»,[91]​ «It's a Hard Life», «Breakthru» (con Roger Taylor), «The Miracle», «I'm Going Slightly Mad»,[91]​ «Friends Will Be Friends» (con John Deacon) y «One Vision» (junto al resto de Queen).[92]​ Otros temas de Queen que compuso Mercury fueron «Great King Rat», «Liar»,[93]​ «Ogre Battle», «The March of the Black Queen»,[94]​ «Stone Cold Crazy», «In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited»,[95]​ «Death on Two Legs», «Love of My Life»,[96]​ «Body Language»,[97]​ «Is This the World We Created...?»,[98]​ «Princes of the Universe» o «Was It All Worth It».[99]​[100]​ El aspecto más notorio de su estilo de composición es el amplio rango de géneros de sus obras, que incluye, entre otros estilos,rockabilly,rockprogresivo,heavy metal,góspelymúsica disco. Como explicó en una entrevista en 1986: «Odio hacer lo mismo todo el tiempo. Me gusta ver lo que está sucediendo en este momento en la música, el cine y el teatro e incorporarlo».[101]​ Comparado con otros artistas, Mercury ha compuesto también obras muy complejas. Por ejemplo, «Bohemian Rhapsody» tiene una estructura poco común y contiene docenas de coros simulando un coro operístico.[102]​[103]​ Por otra parte, «Crazy Little Thing Called Love», contiene pocos coros. Pese al hecho de que Mercury compuso armonías muy intrincadas, como es el caso de «The March of the Black Queen», él mismo declaró que le costaba leer música.[104]​ Escribió la mayoría de sus canciones utilizando un piano en varias claves y tonalidades.[102]​\n",
      "Gracias a los numerosos éxitos de su autoría, a Mercury se le reconoce talento, así como en el canto, en la composición y escritura de canciones.[22]​ Mercury era famoso por sus presentaciones en directo, y recorrió muchos países realizando giras musicales con Queen. Poseía un estilo teatral que a veces requería la participación del público. Un crítico de la revista británicaThe Spectatorlo describió como «un cantante que excita y encanta a su audiencia con varias y extravagantes versiones de sí mismo».[105]​ David Bowie, quien actuó en elconcierto homenaje a Freddie Mercuryy grabó la canción «Under Pressure» con la banda, en una sesión de improvisación musical entre ambos, alabó el estilo de Mercury para comportarse sobre el escenario al afirmar que: «Entre los conciertos derockmás teatrales, Freddie fue el más sobresaliente. Y, por supuesto, siempre he admirado a los hombres que usan trajes de malla. Solo lo vi una vez en concierto y, como dicen, era definitivamente un hombre que podía tener a su audiencia en la palma de la mano».[106]​ En una votación, un grupo de ejecutivos eligió este concierto como la mejor actuación en directo de la historia delrock. Los resultados de esta votación se transmitieron en un programa de televisión llamadoThe World's Greatest Gigs.[107]​[108]​ Un crítico escribió sobre el Live Aid en 2005: «Quienes se dedican a crear listas de los mejores líderes de bandas derocky reservan los primeros lugares paraMick Jagger,Robert Plant, etcétera, cometen un terrible error. Freddie, por su actuación en el Live Aid, es el mejor de ellos».[109]​ Durante su carrera, Mercury participó con Queen en cerca de setecientos conciertos en muchos países.[106]​ El cantante una vez explicó: «Somos losCecil B. DeMilledelrock, siempre queremos hacer las cosas más grandes y mejor».[106]​ La banda se convirtió en el primer grupo británico que tocó en estadios de América Latina, con lo que batieron el récord mundial de congregar a la mayor cantidad de público en elEstadio MorumbienSão Pauloen 1981.[110]​ En 1986, el grupo también tocó tras elTelón de AceroenBudapest, ante ochenta mil personas.[111]​ La última actuación en directo de Mercury con Queen tuvo lugar el 9 de agosto de 1986 enKnebworth, concierto al que asistieron unas trescientas mil personas.[112]​ De niño, en laIndia, tomó clases de piano hasta los nueve años. Más adelante, cuando se mudó aLondres, aprendió a tocar la guitarra. La mayoría de la música que le gustaba se basaba en gran medida en acompañamiento deguitarra: sus artistas favoritos de aquella época eranThe Who,The Beatles,Jimi Hendrix,David BowieyLed Zeppelin. Era muy autocrítico en cuanto a su habilidad para tocar ambos instrumentos y desde principios de los años ochenta comenzó a usar tecladistas invitados para Queen y para su carrera solista. Lo más notable fue la contratación deFred Mandel(un músico estadounidense que había trabajado paraPink Floyd,Elton JohnySupertramp) para su primer trabajo como solista, y que desde 1985 trabajó con el pianistaMike Moranen el estudio y con Spike Edney en concierto.[43]​ Mercury tocó elpianoen muchas canciones de Queen, incluyendo «Killer Queen», «Bohemian Rhapsody», «Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy», «We Are the Champions», «Somebody to Love» y «Don't Stop Me Now». Usaba pianos de cola para conciertos y a veces hasta elclavecín. A partir de 1980 además empezó a usar sintetizadores. El guitarrista de Queen, Brian May, asegura que Mercury no estaba conforme con su manera de tocar el piano y en los conciertos delegaba dicha función porque prefería caminar por el escenario y entretener al público.[43]​ Pese a que escribió muchas líneas de guitarra, Mercury solo tenía las básicas nociones para tocar dicho instrumento. «Ogre Battle» y «Crazy Little Thing Called Love» fueron compuestas con guitarra. En las actuaciones en directo, Mercury usaba guitarra acústica para interpretar esta última canción.[43]​ Mientras que algunos críticos sugieren que Mercury ocultó al público suorientación sexual,[88]​[113]​ otras fuentes se refieren a él como «abiertamentehomosexual».[114]​ Mercury se refirió a sí mismo como «gay» en una entrevista de 1974 con la revistaNME,[115]​ pero hay claras evidencias de que erabisexual.[116]​ En una ocasión, él mismo se definió así.[117]​[118]​ Por otra parte, habitualmente se distanciaba de Jim Hutton durante los eventos públicos en la década de 1980.[106]​ Brian May comentó, al respecto, que considera que «llamarlo gay es algo muy simplista, esto sucede por darle demasiada importancia a su vida personal».[119]​ El cantante supo que eraseropositivosiete años antes de morir, pero introducía los medicamentos en su mansión con total secretismo, para que nadie lo sospechara.[120]​ Sin embargo, tanto Barbara Valentin (quien había sido pareja de Mercury entre 1983 y 1985)[121]​[122]​[123]​ como Jim Hutton (última pareja del músico) mantuvieron posturas distintas sobre cuándo Mercury se enteró de que era VIH positivo. Valentin, en una entrevista ante un medio alemán a la semana del fallecimiento del músico, dijo que él había recibido el diagnóstico seis años antes de su muerte,[e]​ pero esto difiere de la biografíaMercury & meescrita por Hutton, ya que él establece dicha fecha en laPascuade 1987.[124]​ Según un artículo de Laurie Marhoefer, historiadora de políticas trans yqueer, durante la década de 1980 se desató una epidemia de VIH en el Reino Unido. Y tanto las autoridades como otras bandas famosas de la época se mostraron abiertamente homofóbicas, ya que responsabilizaron a los gais de haber propagado la enfermedad. A la vez, existía escasa información sobre cómo mantener relaciones sexuales seguras. Mercury, en todo este contexto, fue objeto de la misma discriminación. Por eso, no hacía mención de su sexualidad públicamente.[125]​ Pese a haber tenido una personalidad muy extravagante en el escenario, Mercury era alguien tímido y reservado, especialmente con los que no conocía bien.[12]​[19]​[88]​ Además, solía conceder pocas entrevistas. Una vez dijo de sí mismo: «Cuando estoy en el escenario soy muy extrovertido, pero por dentro soy completamente diferente».[126]​ Cultivó variadas amistades a lo largo de su vida: conoció a principios de la década de 1970 a Elton John gracias a un enlace con el mánager de John, el empresario musical escocésJohn Reid, quien era pareja del pianista.[127]​ Ya en los años 80, Mercury y John frecuentaban discotecas y fiestas donde se entregaban a todo tipo de excesos, de acuerdo con el mismo John en su autobiografía de 2019,Me:[127]​[128]​.mw-parser-output .flexquote{display:flex;flex-direction:column;background-color:var(--background-color-neutral-subtle);color:var(--color-base);border-left:3px solid var(--border-color-base);font-size:90%;margin:1em 4em;padding:.4em .8em}.mw-parser-output .flexquote>.flex{display:flex;flex-direction:row}.mw-parser-output .flexquote>.flex>.quote{width:100%}.mw-parser-output .flexquote>.flex>.separator{border-left:1px solid var(--border-color-divider);border-top:1px solid var(--border-color-divider);margin:.4em .8em}.mw-parser-output .flexquote>.cite{text-align:right}@media all and (max-width:600px){.mw-parser-output .flexquote>.flex{flex-direction:column}} A través de su amistad con John, Mercury conoció a la princesaDiana de Gales, esposa del entonces príncipe herederoCarlos. Se cuenta que una vez, para proteger la identidad de la noble, Mercury decidió disfrazarla de hombre y él de mujer, y así asistir a una fiesta en un bar gay frecuentado por el cantante[129]​[130]​ Fuentes afirman que fue por medio del presentador Kenny Everett, quien además produjo «Bohemian Rhapsody» para Queen en 1975, así que como conocido común introdujo a Diana a Mercury, quien la ayudó a pasar desapercibida vistiéndola de militar.[129]​ También se hizo amigo deRod Stewart, a quien invitó a las sesiones deThe Workspara que participara de la canción «Let Me Live», que no fue completada y fue reelaborada por los miembros restantes de Queen y lanzada en 1995. Asimismo, Elton John, Stewart y Mercury planearon en los años 80 crear un supergrupo llamadoNose, Teeth & Hair, cuyo nombre se derivaba de las características más evidentes de cada uno de sus tres miembros (Stewart y su nariz prominente, Mercury y su dentadura y John y sualopecia).[131]​[132]​ El cambio de apariencia de Freddie Mercury en la década de 1980 estaba asociado a la estética de los gais, sobre todo por el corte de cabello y el bigote.[119]​ Esto le trajo numerosas críticas, sobre todo en los Estados Unidos, donde algunos seguidores le arrojaron afeitadoras al escenario para pedirle que se afeitara. Y de esa manera «luciera menos gay».[133]​ Freddie Mercury, junto a los miembros de Queen, fueron criticados duramente en la misma década debido a que quebraron un boicot cultural de laONUal realizar una serie de conciertos en un complejo de entretenimiento llamadoSun CityenBofutatsuana, enSudáfrica, cuando todavía imperaba elapartheid, hacia el año 1984. Como resultado de estos conciertos, recibieron muchas críticas de varias revistas, entre ellas deNME. Años después, Roger Taylor, baterista del grupo, admitiría que fue «un error» acudir allí, por el aluvión de críticas recibidas, debido a que la prensa británica del momento interpretó que el hecho de acudir constituía un apoyo indirecto alapartheidque se vivía en el lugar, al tiempo que dijo que Freddie aceptó ir por lo bien pagado que estaba dar el concierto.[109]​ Otra polémica se desató en agosto de 2006, cuando una organización llamadaMovilización y Propagación Islámicasolicitó al ministro de cultura del gobierno de Zanzíbar que suspendiera la celebración a gran escala que tendría lugar por el 60.º aniversario del nacimiento del cantante. Dicha organización argumentaba que Mercury no era de Zanzíbar (a pesar de que había nacido allí) y que, por ser homosexual, contradecía su interpretación de lasaría. Además, consideraba que el hecho de «asociar a Mercury con Zanzíbar degrada nuestra isla, que es parte delislam». Finalmente, la celebración se canceló.[114]​ Según su pareja, Jim Hutton, a Freddie Mercury le diagnosticaronsidadespués de laPascuade 1987.[134]​ En aquella época, Mercury dijo en una entrevista que no padecía esta enfermedad.[88]​ Pese a estas negaciones, la prensa británica alimentó rumores sobre esta posible enfermedad debido a la apariencia de Mercury y a que Queen ya no realizaba giras ni conciertos,[135]​ puesto que el siguiente disco de Queen,The Miracle, si bien había tenido sencillos y videos promocionales, mostraba cambios en el aspecto de Mercury. La última aparición pública de Mercury fue el 18 de febrero de 1990, para la gala de losPremios Britde ese año, con la cual se galardonó a la banda por su contribución a la música británica. En la gala se apreció a un Mercury delgado y con aspecto demacrado. El discurso fue dado por Brian May, mientras que Mercury se limitó a dar las gracias.[136]​ Pese a que su salud empeoraba con el tiempo, Queen grabó el que sería el último disco de la banda con él todavía con vida,Innuendo. El álbum salió al mercado en febrero de 1991[137]​ y la ausencia de Mercury en la fiesta por el lanzamiento del álbum alimentó los rumores sobre su enfermedad,[138]​ sumado a que Queen lanzó algunos videos con fotomontajes de videos previos y en los dos únicos que salió la banda aparecían con una luz blanca en fondo negro, en un intento por ocultar las señales cada vez más obvias del avance del sida. Hacia el final de su vida, muchos periodistas le tomaron fotografías, mientras queThe Sunsugería que estaba realmente muy enfermo.[139]​ El 22 de noviembre de 1991, Mercury llamó almánagerde Queen,Jim Beach, para discutir un asunto público. Al día siguiente, se realizó el siguiente anuncio en nombre del cantante: Al siguiente día de haber redactado esta nota informativa, el 24 de noviembre de 1991, Mercury murió a la edad de 45 años. La causa oficial de su muerte fuebronconeumoníacomplicada por el sida.[141]​ Pese a que no era religioso, su funeral fue dirigido por un sacerdote zoroástrico.Elton John,David Bowiey los miembros de Queen estuvieron presentes. Al término de sus ceremonias de despedida, el cuerpo de Mercury fuecremado. Existen varias teorías sobre el lugar donde fueron a parar sus cenizas; una dice que se hallan en elcementerio de Kensal Green, en Harrow Road, North Kensington,[142]​ otra afirma que fueron esparcidas por Mary Austin a lo largo dellago Lemánde Suiza, donde Mercury vivió sus últimos años y donde se encuentra su monumento conmemorativo, concretamente en la ciudad deMontreux, y una más dice que descansan a los pies del enorme roble que corona el jardín de su residencia Garden Lodge, en Kensington, y que fueron divididas también entre varios teatros londinenses; no obstante, ninguna de estas hipótesis han podido confirmarse hasta ahora.[141]​ En sutestamento, Mercury legó la mayoría de sus bienes, incluida su casa y losderechos de autorsobre sus canciones, a Mary Austin, y el resto a sus parientes y a su hermana Kashmira.[143]​ Además dejó quinientas mil libras esterlinas para su cocinero Joe Fanelli y la misma suma para su asistente Peter Freestone y Jim Hutton, y cien mil para su chofer Terry Giddings.[144]​ Mary Austin continúa viviendo con su familia en la casa de Mercury, llamada Garden Lodge, en Kensington.[144]​ Hutton se mudó aIrlandaen 1995, donde murió el 1 de enero de 2010. Escribió algunos libros sobre la vida de su pareja, entre ellosMercury and MeyFreddie Mercury: The Untold Story, y dio diversas entrevistas para varias publicaciones.[134]​ En los Estados Unidos, donde la popularidad de Queen decayó en la década de 1980, las ventas de sus álbumes crecieron enormemente en 1992, al año siguiente de la muerte de Mercury.[145]​ Ese mismo año, un crítico estadounidense escribió que «lo que los cínicos llaman el factor de la \"estrella muerta\" ha sucedido con Queen, que está resurgiendo».[146]​ La películaWayne's World, que incluye entre subanda sonorala canción «Bohemian Rhapsody», también se estrenó en 1992. Según laRIAA, Queen vendió en total 32.5 millones de álbumes en los Estados Unidos, y más de la mitad se vendió después de la muerte de Mercury en 1991.[147]​ La muerte de Freddie Mercury representó un momento importante en lahistoria del VIH/sida.[148]​ En abril de 1992, los demás miembros de Queen fundaron laMercury Phoenix Trusty organizaron elconcierto tributo a Freddie Mercury para la concienciación del sida.[149]​ El concierto, que tuvo lugar en elestadio de Wembley, incluyó actuaciones en directo deMetallica,George Michael,Lisa Stansfield,Def Leppard,Guns N Roses,Liza Minnellientre otros. Este concierto se transmitió por la televisión pública para todo el mundo y tuvo quinientos millones de espectadores.[150]​ EnMontreux,Suiza, se erigió el 25 de noviembre de 1996 una estatua de tres metros en su honor, esculpida por la escultora de origen checoIrena Sedleckay sufragada por Bommi Bulsara yMontserrat Caballé.[151]​ Se imprimió unaestampilla real en su honory también se colocó una placa en la casa a la que se mudó con su familia en 1964, a los diecisiete años.[151]​ Muchas encuestas revelaron que la reputación de Freddie Mercury creció desde su muerte. Debido a esto, laBBCubicó al cantante en el puesto 58 en la lista de los100 británicos más influyentes, realizada en 2002.[152]​ Pese al hecho de haber sido duramente criticado poractivistas homosexualesdebido a que escondió su condición de portador del virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana, Paul Russell lo incluyó en su libroThe Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present.[153]​ En el Reino Unido, Queen pasó en total más semanas en las listas que ninguna otra banda (incluidosThe Beatles).[154]​ Y el álbum de la bandaGreatest Hitses el disco más vendido en el Reino Unido hasta el día de hoy. En una encuesta hecha porSony Ericsson, dos de las canciones de Mercury, «Bohemian Rhapsody» y «We Are the Champions» aparecieron en las votaciones como las mejores canciones de todos los tiempos.[155]​[156]​ Por el 65.º aniversario del nacimiento de Mercury, el 5 de septiembre de 2011,Googlededicó suGoogle Doodlea él. Incluyó una animación compleja junto con el coro de «Don't Stop Me Now».[157]​[158]​ En 2016, por su 70.º aniversario, Brian May comunicó que elasteroide 17473sería llamado asteroide Freddie Mercury 17473, nombrado así por la Unión Astronómica Internacional. LaUAIdecidió llamar a este asteroide así porque fue descubierto en 1991, año en que Mercury murió.[159]​ El 21 de abril de 2022, en Corea del sur, se inauguró la segunda estatua de Freddie Mercury, aprobada oficialmente porQueen. Esta estatua de tamaño real (altura de1,77 m) está emplazada en la isla Jeju. Fue mandada hacer por el empresario Coreano Baek Soon-yeob. En ella, se puede ver que Mercury está representado como se presentó en el RecitalLive Aidde 1985 en el estadio deWembley.[160]​ Unapelícula biográficasobre Freddie Mercury yQueencon el títuloBohemian Rhapsodyfue estrenada en 2018.[161]​ Está dirigida porBryan Singery la protagonizanRami Malekcomo Mercury,Gwilym LeecomoBrian May,Ben HardycomoRoger TayloryJoseph Mazzellointerpretando aJohn Deacon.

      "Posted onNovember 21st, 2024byDavid CogswellinThe Incessant Traveler The Freddie Mercury Tour in Montreux, Switzerland, was one of those things that at first impression seems displaced. While traveling I am constantly encountering things that seem out of place. Everything is everywhere now. I bought a scarf in Switzerland. For me, it’s a souvenir from Switzerland because that’s where I bought it. But it’s not really Swiss, except that it’s warm wool and perfect for wearing around your neck in the mountains. It’s a Scottish tartan plaid. And it was made in China. It’s a global world now, no way around that, with all the world’s cultures fragmented and flying into each other like shrapnel. Nothing stays in place. Everything is everywhere. It seems that practically every culture is scattered around the world now. You find traces of practically every culture in any world capital now, and increasingly out in the provinces too. Humans have always been a migratory species, marching around the globe and settling in practically every conceivable place. Now, with modern transportation, the process is accelerated. It’s no wonder there’s so much trouble around immigration, not just in the U.S. but in other countries, too, as we saw with Brexit. Marshall McLuhan warned us back in the ‘60s that the electronic media that was connecting the whole world would cause a global implosion, and the cultural collisions would rock all the institutions of the world. We’re seeing these cultural collisions playing out today. From a traveler’s point of view, it is fascinating. It’s culture jamming. Cultural cross-fertilization spurs innovation and creativity and leads to renaissances. So from that point of view, it’s exciting to observe these changes taking place around the world. It’s fascinating when you go to one country and much of what you experience there is actually from other countries. Everything is everywhere and, for a traveler, it provides delicious little surprises wherever you go. The Freddie Mercury tour I took as part of the Tauck Rhine Connoisseur river cruise earlier this month was one of those things that combined elements that I had previously thought of in separate contexts. I didn’t associate Freddie Mercury or his band Queen with Switzerland. My knowledge of Queen is sketchy, but I’m not sure if it would have been possible to live at this period and not have heard some of Queen’s music. “We Will Rock You” is so ingrained in the culture that it’s almost like “Mary Had a Little Lamb” now. I don’t think that song is going away as long as there is human life on planet Earth. But when I saw the city of Montreux on my itinerary, Freddie Mercury was not the first thing that came to mind. Actually Montreux played a large role in the story of Freddie Mercury. He lived in an apartment near the shore of Lake Geneva in Montreux for about 13 years, in the final period before he died November 4, 1991, at age 45. In the case of Freddie Mercury, many cultures are crammed into the package. He was himself a cross-cultural phenomenon. He was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town, Zanzibar, to Parsi-Indian parents. He attended boarding schools in India from the age of 8 through secondary school. That’s where he began to learn to play the piano. He returned to his parents in Zanzibar after secondary school, then in 1964 his family moved to England to escape the Zanzibar Revolution. In 1970 he joined with the other musicians in a band that would become Queen. The tour called “In the Footsteps of Freddie Mercury” was conducted by a company calledFreddie Tours. The program itself, independent of the subject, was an innovative production. Each participant in the tour was given a tablet like a large iPhone to hang around the neck, and a set of cushioned, vinyl-covered headphones. We were led on a walking tour by a guide, whose throat mic was amplified through the headphones. But we also had the tablets, and at various points of the tour we would stop and look at a video presentation on the tablet to augment the in-person narrative. It was a great touch, bringing the video into the program without having to be somewhere where there were mounted screens. Each participant had their own screen. Our guide was Lucien Muller, a Montreux native who has been passionately involved with preserving Freddie Mercury’s legacy for many years. He is the president of Montreux Celebration, which organizes the “Freddie Celebration Days” festival, which was created by his parents in 2001. The content of the tour program and the videos was primarily compiled from personal reminiscences of Peter Freestone, Mercury’s personal assistant for 12 years, living with him till his death. It’s a very intimate portrait. Lucien Muller and Peter Freestone have been friends and associates for many years. We walked along the shore of the sublime Lake Geneva, and our guide pointed out the Les Tourelles residential building down the shore from us where Freddie had his flat. The beauty of that place is voluptuous, a real pleasure to behold. But clearly, the highlight of the Freddie Tour was the Freddie Mercury museum housed in the Montreux Casino. It’s one flight up and overlooking the slot machines, craps tables, roulette wheels and the massive cluster of spinning and blinking neon-colored lights of the gaming floor. The museum is called “Queen: The Studio Experience”. It’s housed in the space that was once Mountain Studios, which Queen owned from 1979 to 1993, and where they recorded several of their albums. There was another striking and odd historical link to the casino. Today’s casino stands where a previous casino was burned down, the subject of the song by Deep Purple called “Smoke on the Water”. The story told in the song was that Frank Zappa and the Mothers were playing at the casino and someone in the audience fired a flare gun up to the wooden ceiling. The ensuing fire, as the song described it, “burned the place to the ground.” Deep Purple were having dinner at a restaurant when the incident took place and they had a view of it. Hence the title “Smoke on the Water.” “Well, we all came down to Montreux on the Lake Geneva Shoreline…” The casino was also the main venue for the Monteux Jazz Festival and was, as the song said, “the best place around” for musicians to play. It was burned down December 4, 1971, then rebuilt and reopened in 1975. It’s still a major venue for the Jazz Festival. The person believed to have started the fire has never been apprehended. The museum had a rich collection of information and memorabilia. Several of Freddie’s wild stage outfits were on display in glass cases. They were close enough that you could have touched them if not for the glass. It was an eerie, almost tangible connection with Freddie because he wore those clothes. They retained his physical imprint, not to mention whatever vibes and resonances could exist unnamed. It was very evocative, like a reminder of a meeting that never took place. There was a mixing board left over from Mountain Studio from when Queen owned it. There were sheets of paper with lyrics hand-written, left over from when the songs were being worked on in the studio. There were musical instruments, some originals and others replicas of the ones Queen used to record there. Some of the displays incorporated small video screens, or sound recordings accessible through headphones. One display was simply a timeline painted on a wall showing stats from the Queen career, and they were impressive. Here are a few: As the life story narrative wound towards its tragic close, the tour wound its way to the site of the Freddie Mercury statue at Lake Geneva’s edge. It was moving. It was a good way of developing some real understanding of the work of Freddie Mercury and Queen, and a good foundation for further exploration. Some of the songs, with their great spirit of defiance and strength, like “We Are the Champions”, seem to be good anthems for today. It was a great experience, a great moment on that tour, a great thing to do when you are in Montreux.  David Cogswell is a freelance writer working remotely, from wherever he is at the moment.

      "Freddie Mercury is one of the rock world’s most versatile and engaging performers as the lead singer of Queen. He is best known for his mock operatic masterpiece, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which was also the title of a 2018 biopic on the performer’s life. Freddie Mercury was a singer-songwriter and musician whose music reached the top of U.S. and British charts in the 1970s and 1980s. As the frontman of Queen, Mercury was one of the most talented and innovative singers of the rock era. Born Farrokh Bulsara in Tanzania, Mercury studied piano in boarding school in India, then befriended numerous musicians at London's Ealing College of Art. Mercury died of AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia on November 24, 1991, at age 45. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5, 1946, in Zanzibar. Mercury's parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were Parsees, or followers of the Zoroastrian religion whose ancestors came from Persia. After Bomi and Jer married, they moved to Zanzibar, Tanzania, where Bomi worked as a cashier for the British government's High Court. The family lived a fairly affluent life, with a nanny and other domestic workers. Mercury's sister, Kashmira, was born in 1952. At the age of 8, Mercury's parents sent him to a boarding school in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, where he studied piano and spent his free time with his aunt and grandparents. It was not long before the charismatic young man joined his first band, the Hectics. In 1963, Mercury returned to Zanzibar. Following a bloody revolution on the islands in 1964, the family fled to London. Mercury attended the Ealing College of Art and befriended a number of musicians. In 1969, Mercury joined a group called Ibex as their lead singer. He played with a few other bands before joining forces with his future Queen bandmates. Mercury was born with four extra teeth in the back of his mouth, causing his now-famous bucktooth grin. In fact, his nickname growing up was Bucky. Mercury never got his teeth fixed because he was afraid it would ruin his impressive four-octave vocal range. Mercury met his future bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May, around the time he moved to London in the 1960s. They met up with bassist John Deacon in 1971. The quartet, which Mercury dubbedQueen, played their first gig together that June. READ MORE: Freddie Mercury Was Part of Brian May and Roger Taylor's Entourage Before Forming Queen In 1973, Queen released their first album, titledQueen. They quickly followed up with their second album,Queen II, in 1974, which they recorded in over just one month. The album was the first taste of the group's signature harmonies and music styles, including ballads, folk, blues, metal, pop and rock, and included the single \"Seven Seas of Rhye.\" Queen's music, however, really only caught on with their third record,Sheer Heart Attack,also released in 1974. With a sound that has been described as a fusion of hard rock and glam rock, Queen had an even bigger hit the following year with their fourth album,A Night at the Opera(1975). Queen's popularity continued to soar through the late 70s and early 80s withA Day at the Races(1976),News of the World(1978) andThe Game(1980). AfterThe Works(1984), the group's ability to sell albums began to wane, although Queen continued to draw huge crowds as a live act around the world. In addition to his talents as a singer and songwriter, Mercury was a skilled showman. He knew how to entertain audiences and how to connect with them. He liked to wear costumes — often featuring skintight spandex — and strutted around the stage, encouraging fans to join in the fun. Artistic in nature, Mercury was also actively involved in designing the art for many of the group's albums. Mercury also lived a lavish lifestyle. He loved champagne and liked to collect art, once spending more than $400,000 on a set of hand-painted china. Always one for a party, Mercury threw himself elaborate celebrations; for one particular birthday, he flew a group of friends to the island of Ibiza. The occasion was marked by fireworks and flamenco dancing. By 1989, Mercury largely retreated from public life. He did not promote or tour for Queen's next album,Innuendo(1991), and rumors about possible health problems began to circulate. Before his death, Mercury worked in the studio with Queen. These efforts were released in 1995 onMade In Heaven, the group's last album with all the original members. Gone but clearly not forgotten, this collection of Mercury's final performances reached the top of the British charts. Mercury and Queen were recognized for their contributions to American music history when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Queen's third album,Sheer Heart Attack,featured their first hit, \"Killer Queen,\" a song about a high-class call girl. The 1974 single hit No. 2 on the U.K. charts, and peaked at No. 12 in the U.S. Unlike most of his other music, Mercury wrote the lyrics before the music. Mercury wrote the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" a seven-minute rock operetta for the 1975 album,A Night at the Opera. Overdubbing his voice, Mercury showed off his four-octave vocal range on this innovative track. The song hit the top of the charts in Britain and became a Top 10 hit in the United States. The 1978 hit \"We Are the Champions,\" off of the albumNews of the World, became a Top 10 song in the United States and in Britain. It was featured on a single with \"We Will Rock You.\" Both songs have taken on a life of their own as popular anthems played at sporting events. Always exploring new and different sounds, Queen tried their hand at the big music trend of the time with the disco-flavored \"Another One Bites the Dust,\" from their 1980 albumThe Game. Also on ofThe Game, Mercury and the rest of the band showed their range as performers with the rockabilly-influenced 1980 hit \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" which Mercury penned. In 1981, Queen collaborated withDavid Bowieto create\"Under Pressure.\"A No. 1 hit in Britain, the song's distinctive bass line was later reportedly used by Vanilla Ice for his 1990 rap hit \"Ice, Ice Baby.\" READ MORE: Inside David Bowie and Queen’s 'Tense' Recording Session for \"Under Pressure\" Although Queen's popularity began to wane in the mid-1980s, the group had a minor hit in 1984 with \"Radio Ga Ga.\" Pop musicianLady Gagatook inspiration for her stage name from the song. In addition to his work with Queen, Mercury released several solo albums, including 1985'sMr. Bad Guy. He also collaborated with opera singer Montserrat Caballé for 1988'sBarcelona. One of Queen's most notable performances was in 1985 at the Live Aid charity concert. Simply dressed in a tank top and jeans, Mercury led the crowd through some of the band's greatest hits with great energy and style. He got the thousands of music fans at London's Wembley Stadium to chant along to \"We Will Rock You.\" For many who watched the event live or on television, Queen gave one of the top performances of the day-long event, which was organized by singer and activist Bob Geldof and songwriter Midge Ure to raise money for victims of famine in Africa. Inspired by the event, the band wrote the hit \"One Vision.\" Offstage, Mercurywas open about his bisexuality, but he kept his relationships private. He was engaged toMary Austinand had a seven-year relationship with Jim Hutton until his untimely death. Austin met Mercury in 1969 when she was a 19-year-old music store employee and he was a 24-year-old on the cusp of stardom. They quickly began dating; Mercury wrote the ballad “Love of My Life\" for Austin. In 1973 Mercury proposed; the wedding was called off when he revealed to her that he was bisexual. The pair remained close, and Austin tended to Mercury after his AIDS diagnosis. Mercury entrusted most of his estate and his London mansion, Garden Lodge, to Austin, who later married and had two kids. “All my lovers asked me why they couldn’t replace Mary, but it’s simply impossible,” Mercury saidin a 1985 interview. “The only friend I’ve got is Mary, and I don’t want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that’s enough for me.” READ MORE: Meet Mary Austin, the Woman Who Stole Freddie Mercury's Heart Mercury met Hutton, an Irish hairdresser, in the 1980s at a gay nightclub in London. Mercury offered to buy Hutton a drink; Hutton didn't recognize the superstar and turned him down. The pair reconnected a year and a half later at another night club. This time they began dating, and Hutton moved in with Mercury less than a year later. Although Mercury never came out, the couple stayed together until Mercury died of AIDS in 1991. After Mercury's death, Austin reportedly kicked Hutton out of Garden Lodge. Hutton later wrote a book about his relationship with the singer,Mercury and Me.He died of cancer in 2010 at the age of 60. READ MORE: The Complicated Nature of Freddie Mercury's Sexuality Mercury died from AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia at his London mansion on November 24, 1991. He was 45 years old. The day before his death, on November 23, 1991, Mercury released a statement: \"I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV-positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease.\" Longtime friend and bandmate Roger Taylor provided some insight to Mercury's decision to keep his battle with AIDS private. \"He didn't want to be looked at as an object of pity and curiosity, and he didn't want circling vultures over his head,\" Taylor said, according to a report inEntertainment Weekly. The rock world mourned the loss of one of its most versatile and engaging performers. To honor his memory, the Freddie Mercury Tribute: Concert for AIDS Awareness was held in April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. A diverse range of rock acts — from Def Leppard toElton John— performed to celebrate Mercury and advance the fight against the disease that took his life. That same year, Mercury's mock operatic masterpiece, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" appeared in the movieWayne's Worldand made a return to theBillboard 100pop charts, illustrating its timeless appeal. Released in 2018, the movieBohemian Rhapsody, starringMr. Robot'sRami Malekas Mercury, follows the rise of Queen leading up to their legendary Live Aid performance in 1985. Following the movie's release, Queen's music saw a resurgence in popularity decades after their last studio album. The group's song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" shot from 87th place globally on Spotify the day before the movie's release to 15th one week later, and it hit theBillboard 100for a third time.

      " Making Queer History has a vague title because it has a rather vague purpose. We are not alone in our aim to tell the queer community’s history. What defines us is our focus not only on the past, but toward the future. Freddie Mercury singing and wearing a black and white harlequin pattern bodysuit. \"Does it mean this, does it mean that, that's all anybody wants to know. I'd say what any decent poet would say if anyone dared ask him to analyze his work: if you see it, darling, then it's there!\" – Freddie Mercury Being queer in the public eye is a whole different domain from being queer as a regular person. We are not usually representatives for our community—though queer people of color and particularly black queer women are especially punished through hypervisibility. Choosing to be open or not is a personal choice, and it’s especially hard when most of your life is up for public consumption. Are queer people in the spotlight required to be open about their identity and experiences? Absolutely not. More importantly, are queer celebrities who don’t publicly “come out” living any less openly than your average queer person? Freddie Mercury is arguably one of the most well known rock musicians, yet somehow, many people don’t know he was bisexual. Some assume he was straight by default. Others genuinely believe he was gay. Ultimately, the misconceptions come from two places. First, the erasure of bisexual people, particularly bisexual men. The second is Mercury’s choice to have a private life as a celebrity, something completely within his right, that also left room for people to make assumptions. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on the 5th of September, 1946 in Zanzibar. His parents moved from western India to Zanzibar before he and his sister were born in order for his father to continue his work. Despite their move, Mercury spent the majority of his childhood living with relatives in India. He started taking piano lessons when he was seven years old, and started attending St. Peter’s School shortly after. At the boarding school he befriended and started a band with some classmates. It was around this time that he started going by Freddie. Long before he wrote his own music, his school band played covers of rock and roll songs. He moved back in with his parents in Zanzibar when he was 16, but the ensuing war caused the family to relocate to England. Because Mercury was born in Zanzibar, a British protectorate at the time, he was able to register as a citizen of the UK a few years later. At the same time, he finished his study at Ealing Art College with a degree in graphic art and design. After graduation he did a variety of work, including working as an airport baggage handler, selling second-hand clothing, and joining several bands. One of his co-workers was Roger Taylor, who would later be the drummer for his most successful band. Leading up to their collaboration, Mercury joined two different bands. He joined and quickly left Ibex, later called Wreckage. Following their failure, he joined Sour Milk Sea. When they failed just as quickly, he joined Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May to become their lead singer. John Deacon joined the band a year later, and the band was already seeing more success than Mercury’s past endeavors. Around the same time, he changed both the band’s and his own name. He thought over the band name for some time, and even began work on the logo before decided on the name Queen. He explained the name saying: \"It's just a name, but it's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.” He, of course, became Freddie Mercury. The name came from his song, “My Fairy King.” Of the name change, Taylor said: \"[H]e was serious and he changed his name to Freddie Mercury. I think changing his name was part of him assuming this different skin. I think it helped him be this person that he wanted to be, and the Bulsara person was still there, but for the public he was going to be this different character.\" Most people know Freddie Mercury as a major musical talent; singing, performing, and songwriting. To be certain, Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen's Greatest Hits album. His popularity and talent is unquestionable. His personal life is, intentionally and unintentionally, less so. He wasn’t necessarily closeted, and, in his personal life, he was open about the men and women he loved. He had a variety of relationships throughout his life, but two stand out. The first is Mary Austin. Mercury and Austin met through Queen’s guitarist, Brian May. They began a years-long relationship in the early ‘70s and remained together until 1976, even living together for years. After having an affair with another man, Mercury came out to her in late 1976. While their romantic relationship ended then, their friendship continued throughout his life. She was his best friend; in fact, he sometimes called her his only friend. They confided in each other. She picked out the last home he lived in, and he was the godfather to her eldest son. He said of their relationship: \"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.\" Later, in his will, he left his home to her. His reasoning was, “You would have been my wife, and it would have been yours anyway.” The second is Jim Hutton. The two met in 1985, when Hutton actually turned Mercury down, as he was in a relationship. Months later the two began dating—Mercury’s second long-term relationship. They moved in together shortly after. While they could not be legally married, Freddie Mercury called Jim his husband and both wore wedding rings. Mercury described their relationship as one of mutual understanding. When Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987, he feared Hutton would leave, but said he’d understand. In response, Jim Hutton said: \"Don’t be stupid. I’m not going anywhere. I’m here for the long haul.\" That was the truth. They spent the last few years of Mercury’s life together, with Hutton taking care of him until the end. Mercury kept his illness private, as he was generally a shy and reserved person in his private life. When he passed away on the 24th of November, 1991, Hutton was there at his bedside. Freddie Mercury was cremated with the gold wedding ring Hutton had given him. Supposedly, his ashes were later spread by Austin. After Austin inherited the house, Jim Hutton relocated the home he and Mercury had built in Ireland. To erase his love for either of these people would not only unnecessarily erase important parts of his life, it would be cruel to his legacy and the people he loved. Why, then, is his sexuality so often ignored or erased? There are two primary issues. First, bisexual people in relationships are constantly deemedactuallystraight oractuallygay, depending entirely on their partner and not at all on their own identity. Some will use the fact that he kept his relationship with Jim Hutton private as an excuse to erase it entirely. Second, queer celebrities are seen as hiding their sexuality if they don’t constantly and vocally come out, even if they live openly. This has been a growing issue in recent years especially, with queer celebrities being accused of queerbaiting for being in same gender relationships without explicitly coming out online. Let’s be clear—real people can’t queerbait and queer celebrities are allowed to have private lives. Actor Kal Penn recently announced his engagement to his now-fiance of 11 years, and headlines immediately turned to “Kal Penn has come out.” In reality, he was out to people in his personal life and he was clearly out to his partner. We don’t know to what extent he was out, and he had no obligation to tell us. Freddie Mercury lived openly in his expression, in his music, and in his love. The fact that he did not specifically label his identity in an interview with a reporter doesn’t negate that. To whom should he have come out to appease those who would erase his life? To whom did he owe an explanation? It’s one thing to be upset about media that refuses to label a bisexual person’s identity while expecting praise for their mediocre representation. It’s another thing to put those expectations on real people, even celebrities. Mercury’s choice, for the variety of reasons he made it, to keep his relationships private washischoice to make. He also chose to keep his HIV status private, as was his right. Queer people, disabled people, and chronically ill people don’t owe anyone our stories or the intimate details of our lives. There is no shame in finding comfort and power in people have lived before us and share our experiences. As queer people, we look to history to find comfort, understanding, and safety. “If they’ve done it, so can I.” That is the heart of our work. However, the truth is that those we admire and look to are still people. We cannot know everything about them, and we cannot expect them to have shared everything about themselves. In fact, Mercury once said: \"I don't talk to everybody, so they don't really know the real me.\" Disclaimer: some of the sources may contain triggering material Blake, M.

      "With the release of a new film about the British rock band Queen, the spotlight has fallen again on the life of its legendary lead singer, Freddie Mercury. His flamboyant stage presence, outlandish costumes, memorable hits, fluid sexuality, and death from an Aids-related illness at just 45 are defining memories of the British rock scene of the 1970s and 1980s. Less well-known - and barely mentioned in the film - is that he was born in the Tanzanian archipelago of Zanzibar to a family whose roots lie in India and Persia. Here are five things you should know about Freddie Mercury and Zanzibar, a conservative Muslim society: Mercury was born in Zanzibar's Government Hospital on 5 September 1946. His parents Bomi and Jer Bulsara were Parsees - followers of the Zoroastrian religion whose ancestors came from Persia - but they had lived in India. Bomi Bulsara came from Bulsar in Gujarat - hence the family name - and moved to Zanzibar to work in the High Court as a cashier for the British government. He married Jer in India and brought her back to Zanzibar. Farrokh, their first born, was followed six years later by a daughter, Karishma. Mercury did not often speak publicly about his upbringing in Zanzibar, but that has not stopped a lucrative tourist trade growing around him in the archipelago. Today, Queen fans can take tours of his childhood haunts - including his home, his family's place of worship and the court where his father worked. There is also a Freddie Mercury restaurant and gift shop. More problematic for many Zanzibaris - and for Zoroastrians - is Mercury's bisexuality. Islam is the predominant religion on the archipelago and gay sex was made illegal in 2004. There was outrage from one Muslim group in 2006when it was rumoured gay tourists were making their way to the island for a beach party to mark Mercury's 60th birthday. The BBC's Aboubakar Famau in Tanzania says that although some aspects of the late singer's lifestyle are controversial in a conservative Islamic society, there is still a sense of pride in him. \"They are proud of him, they sense that they have someone from the island who has touched the international level in the music industry,\" he said. Freddie's first cousin, Perviz Darunkhanawala,described in Bohemian Rhapsody, the biography of Mercuryby Lesley-Ann Jones, that the family had lived a fairly affluent life considering Bomi's civil servant wage. They lived in a comfortable flat overlooking the sea in Stone Town, the historic part of Zanzibar city, with its maze of narrow alleyways lined with shops, houses, bazaars and mosques. As well as domestic workers, they also had a nanny called Sabine. Mercury's first years of schooling were at the Zanzibar Missionary School, where he was taught by Anglican nuns. But at the age of eight, his parents decided to send him to school in India. He went to St Peter's Church of England school in Panchgani, a former British Raj hill station south-east of what was then Bombay (Mumbai). You may also like: Despite being a church school, St Peter's welcomed children of all faiths and Mercury was a fully practising Zoroastrian during his time there. It was during free time spent with his aunt and grandparents in Bombay that he discovered and indulged a growing love of music. He also formed his first band with friends, The Hectics. Freddie returned to Zanzibar in 1963 - the year it gained independence from Britain - and completed his last years of education at the Roman Catholic St Joseph's Convent School, Lesley-Ann Jones writes in her biography. A friend from that time recalled to Jones how they used to go swimming in the sea after school, or take bike rides out to beaches further south. \"He was always smartly dressed,\" remembered Bonzo Fernandez. But the good times were short-lived. In 1964, a revolution overthrew the ruling Arab elite, and as many as 17,000 people were killed. A republic was then established with the presidents of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, on the mainland, signing an act of union. They formed the United Republic of Tanzania with Zanzibar having semi-autonomous status. The Bulsara family, along with many others, fled the islands. Copyright 2025 BBC.

      "PDF transcript.Also available via ourBuzzsprout page. Can you believe it? We are 15 episodes into HISTORY OF THE WORLD (RELIGIONS), Part 1 — and we have evenmorecoming for you! On this episode, we are demonstrating whyZoroastrianism > Freddie Mercury. This episode, we’re joined byKainaz Amaria, a Fulbright scholar, filmmaker, journalist, visual artist, and Zoroastrian. Religion: it’s imperial! We started calling the cluster of things we now call religion (rituals! Sacred texts! Holy spaces! Ways of marking time and stages of life as special! Ways of knowing and explanations for how things got to be the way they are! Et cetera!)--we started calling this cluster “religion” precisely AS we started having things like nation-states, and those nation-states started using this cluster to explain why they could and should and would take over the territory and resources and humans of other regions. And boy howdy do we see imperialism in action when we’re talking about Zoroastrianism. As we’ve been saying for what feels like forever, religion is imperial. And Zoroastrianism is one of the ways people do religion in the world (duh). So learning more about Zoroastrianism makes you more religiously literate. This is a small tradition compared to, say, Buddhism, but it’s still internally diverse and deeply interesting. Since most folks do not know what Zoroastrianism is, we started at the beginning. Zoroastrianism is an ancient Persian monotheistic religion and is possibly/probably the world’s oldest monotheism. Most of the world’s Zoroastrians live in India (and also Iran). I know Zoroastrians in India also call themselvesParsis. In fact, in India they call themselves (and are called) Parsis because they’re Persian — Parsi basicallymeansPersian, and Pars (or Fars) is a region of Iran still today. Also, because imperialism is important, you should know practitioners of this tradition did not start out calling themselves Zoroastrians. The tradition was founded by a man named Zoroaster or Zarathustra and – surprise, surprise – when European colonizers showed up in India, they asked about founders and holy books and then started calling this community after the name of its founder. Thus: Zoroastrianism in textbooks, Parsis for many community members, and other names for self in other periods. Zoroastrianism is often summed up by:good thoughts, good words,andgood deeds.   This effort is reflected in a symbol called thefaravahar– this example works really well in an audio medium, obvs, but picture a big beardy dude with huge three tiered wings, facing to the left. The three tiers of his left-hand wings represent good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; the tiers on the right-hand wings represent bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds. Zoroastrians are supposed to turn toward the good and away from the bad; some Zoroastrians wear the faravahar as a reminder for them to do just that. Even though it’s comparatively small, with something like 200,000 practitioners worldwide, Zoroastrianism isstillvery much aglobal religion! There are Zoroastrians all over the world—and Zoroastrianism is shaped by its global spread, sometimes under explicit religious persecution, other times based on broader, European imperialist distaste for their colonized subjects, and other times because of how people move about in modernity. Most Zoroastrians live in India and Iran, as we said above, but there are also Zoroastrian communities in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, the UK, Australia, Zanzibar, Kenya, New Zealand, and the USA. So, in short: small religion by population, not by global spread, and some of that we live everywhere thing is about, you guessed it, colonialism. Kainaz Amariajoined us to share her experiences as a Fulbright scholar documenting the Zoroastrian community in India, her experiences as a member of this small-but-global community, and her approach to religions visually. Ms. Amaria isVox’s Visual Editor,formerly an editor for NPR’s Visual Team, and before that she was a freelance photographer in Mumbai for outlets like theNew York Times, Vogue India, andReuters.  Meganwanted us to remember that Zoroastrians are still Zoroastrianing! When this community makes the news, the story is usually about the people and the religion supposedly dying out. But Zoroastrianism is NOT dying out – it’s just changing, because the communities who do Zoroastrianism are changing. Ilysewanted us to remember colonialism, and why the patterns of movement — like Freddie Mercury’s own family! — reflect colonial violence. Ilysetalked to us a lot about Freddie Mercury, much beloved late lead singer of Queen, who is (arguably) the world’s most recognizable Zoroastrian/Parsi. Megancheated and gave us two factoids this week. She’s unstoppable. First, Megan shared with us the relationship between India’s PM Modi and Parsis being held up as a model minority within his (very Hindu nationalist) government. Second she shared a deeply embarrassing and problematic memory of our cherished guest, Kainaz Amaria, who happened to be Megan’s college roommate for a minute. And this is a story of Megan’s tragic love of Kipling meeting an actual-factual person of South Asian descent. Shenanigans ensue. Work has been done to repair and reflect. Meganwants us to check outKainaz Amaria’s recent work on the website for Vox, where she is the Visual Editor. She’s done some really striking photography-driven political reporting; I’ve especially appreciated her voice and insights on how racism and exploitative images of human suffering inform reporting on people of color particularly in times of crisis. We’ll link to her Vox page in the shownotes, but listeners might be especially interested inthe piece she did with Sigal Samuel (former religion editor at Atlantic, now senior reporter at Vox) on 45’s praising India for religious freedom while anti-Muslim violence was erupting in February 2020. Ms. Amaria also curated a fascinating (and deeply upsetting) gallery of images from the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem in 2018,which can be found here. The must-watch piece of Ms. Amaria’s work is the short film she produced as a Fulbright scholar in Mumbai in 2010. It’s called“Being Zoroastrian,”runs about 10 minutes, and provides complex personal and community insights into contemporary Parsi belonging. Beyond Ms. Amaria’s work, check out: A piece from Middle East Eye about the Zoroastrian priestesses of Iran,available here Megan likes to juxtapose the pieceShaun Walker wrote forthe Guardiancalled “The Last of the Zoroastrians”withAmy dePaul’s “Zoroastrianism Rises in North America” forWSJ. Megan also did abig lecture thread on Zoroastrianismwhen she was teaching Global Religions remotely. While prepping for this episode, Megan found a cool item about ancient Zoroastrian texts being found in China, written by Ursula Sims-Williams, who is Curator of Iranian languages at the British Library and thus, I assume, knows whereof she writes.Check it out. And lastly and perhaps most randomly,Dave Malloy’s “Moby Dick: A Musical Reckoning,”includes a fourth-wall break moment where a character does a real quick compare and contrast between Zoroastrianism and Islam.

      "During one emotionally fraught scene in Bohemian Rhapsody, the new biopic of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, the world-renowned singer (played excellently by Rami Malek) cautiously looks up at his… ByStephen Daw Pride Editor In telling Freddie Mercury’s authentic story,Bohemian Rhapsodyhad a difficult task. The Queen singer was notoriously private about many aspects of his life, but one particular aspect has remained a point of interest among fans even today, nearly 30 years after his passing: his sexuality. See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news  During one emotionally fraught scene in the new biopic, Mercury (portrayed vividlyby Rami Malek) cautiously looks up at his fiancée and soon-to-be-friend Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and says, “I think I’m bisexual.” His lover looks down at him, almost pityingly, and retorts. “No, Freddie. You’re gay.”  For many out there, this particular moment almost rang too true to real life. Bisexual people face the reality of bi-erasure on a near-daily basis, being told that they’re either “too gay” or “not gay enough,” with little to no attention paid to their actual sexual identity. So it’s natural that many critics and Twitter users would callBohemian Rhapsodyout for attempting to erase Mercury’s bisexuality in this scene, especially in a film meant to celebrate him. But was it really erased? In the almost 10 years leading up to the release ofBohemian Rhapsody, fans of Queen and Mercury have all nervously waited to see how his story would be translated to the big screen. Many worried that the superstar’s sexuality, which he refused to publicly identify during his lifetime, and his contraction of and death by AIDS would be absent from the story presented to a wider audience. But telling the “real” story of Freddie Mercury’s life is more complicated than many are willing to admit. The rock icon was extremely secretive about his private life, and wanted his fans and the press to focus on his music. Since his tragic death in 1991, fellow founding members Brian May and Roger Taylor have fiercely protected his privacy, often declining to talk extensively about the frontman’s sexuality and AIDS diagnosis in interviews.   Yet even without being openly bisexual, Mercury still laid claim to his queerness when performing. He never compromised his appearance, his music or his behavior to appeal to a mainstream heteronormative audience — in fact, he constantly dared to challenge their aggressive normality. The film itself has seen plenty of drama surrounding the direction in which its story would be taken. Actor Sacha Baron Cohen famously walked away from the role after clashing with May and Taylor, tellingHoward Stern in 2016that he wanted to tell a “warts and all” story about Mercury’s life, while the band members seemed more interested in “protecting their legacy.” All of this is not even to mention the constant creative struggles that led to original director Bryan Singer’s firing. When the first trailer forBohemian Rhapsodywas released, fansflocked to social mediato express their outrage over what they perceived to be the queer erasure they were half-expecting to see. And they were correct in their assessment — the initial trailer showed Mercury and Austin dancing and flirting, but showed absolutely no indication of any same-sex romance or even interest. The final product does, though, look at Mercury’s life through a pragmatic, albeit somewhat rose-tinted, lens. His struggle with his own sexuality is explored at length throughout the film, along with entire sections dedicated to his drug-fueled benders through gay clubs in Berlin, his complex romance with his manager Paul Prenter, his constant love and admiration for Austin and his eventual AIDS diagnosis.  So is Mercury’s bisexuality erased in that fateful scene with Mary Austin? No, it is made to be real. The singer spent most of his life battling the public, the press and even some in his personal life about how he chose to identify himself. Many labeled him as gay, some denied his queerness, and very few chose to validate his inherent bisexuality. It’s upsetting to watch on screen because real life is often more bleak than fantasy. That internal and external battle for self-realization is present in another of the film’s prominent scenes, when a massive press conference turns into a public trial about Freddie’s personal life. With reporters asking Mercury about his sexuality, his relationships, his drug habits and more, he slowly begins to fall into a dizzying haze where he loses control. Malek’s well-crafted portrayal of Mr. Fahrenheit is a credit to the film’s desire to explore each aspect of the iconic singer’s personality. In the scenes where Freddie is confronted with his own sexual demons, Malek manages to both unite and alienate the audience in their sympathy and astonishment for the singer’s scenario. All of this is not to say that the film handles everything regarding Mercury’s queerness well.Bohemian Rhapsody’s approach to those aforementioned benders in gay clubs and the singer’s eventual diagnosis with AIDS are inaccurate at best, and at worst, insulting to Mercury’s life and the LGBTQ community at large.  For example, after months of being coerced into a pattern of constant sex and partying by his assistant and lover, the film’s Freddie leaves him and receives his diagnosis, almost as if it were a punishment. His discovery of AIDS rings true less as the heartbreaking reality for a queer man in the 1980s, and more as a price that he paid for what the film deems his “bad behavior.” Rhapsody’s treatment of Paul Prenter also presents itself as problematic from early on in the film. While Mercury’s former lover and assistant is often considered a villain in real life for outing the singer in a 1987 interview with British tabloidThe Sun, the film goes to great lengths to make Prenter out to be the gay devil on Mercury’s shoulder, encouraging him at every turn to indulge in a stereotypically queer lifestyle only to be later vilified for it. With missteps in telling the story of Mercury’s sexual identity, the film deserves criticism for its portrayal of the rock icon’s life. But it should also be considered that had these moments been handled in a better, more accurate way, the film likely would have still drawn criticism. The chief problem thatBohemian Rhapsodyruns into throughout its nearly two and a half hour runtime is that it wants to be everything to everyone. It aims to satisfy the fans of Queen who want a behind-the-scenes look at the making of some of their favorite songs. It aims to satisfy fans of Mercury, who want to see the icon’s personal life reflected in an accurate, all-encompassing light. It aims to satisfy moviegoers who simply want to see an entertaining film about a rockstar. The truth is that there likely is no satisfactory way to portray Freddie Mercury’s life on the big screen, as it contained multitudes. Throughout his life, Mercury refused to be defined by one particular aspect of himself and favored reinvention and change over stasis. No matter how much we think we know about the superstar’s life, we will always be left to wonder about some things. And maybe that’s for the best. When all is said and done, maybe what makes Freddie Mercury one of the most fascinating musicians of all time is that while his queerness cannot be denied, it will always be shrouded in his own distinct mystique.

      "This Day In History:November 24 Changing the day will navigate the page to that given day in history. You can navigate days by using left and right arrows 1991 On November 24, 1991,Freddie Mercury, British rock superstar and frontman for the bandQueen, died from bronchial pneumonia caused by AIDS. A virtuoso vocalist known for his flamboyant style and remarkable four-octave vocal range, Mercuryannounced his AIDS diagnosis to the public just one day before his death, despite knowing his status—and fending off public inquiry—for years. Mercury had been officially diagnosed in 1987, but is first reported to have sought medical help for the virus in 1982, while his meteoric music career was still in full swing. Born in 1946 to Parsi parents who had immigrated from western India to Zanzibar, Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara) showed an early inclination for the arts. His family moved to Feltham, England when he was 17, which soon led to Bulsara playing in bands around London, and eventually meeting guitarist Brian Mays and drummer Roger Taylor. The trio founded Queen in 1970 and brought on bassist John Deacon a year later. During that time, Bulsara also changed his name to Freddie Mercury. Over the next decade, with their blend of glam and heavy metal rock, Queen would rocket to international superstardom, releasing global hits like “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “We Are The Champions” and “We Will Rock You,” anthemic songs bolstered by the group’s trademark superb guitar work and Mercurys operatic vocals. By the 1980s, Queen had become an international phenomenon—and Mercury, one of the world’s most popular rock stars. Despite his grandiosity on stage, however, in his personal life Mercury was famously private and rarely granted interviews to reporters. And despite romances with men, he lived most of his life with his best friendMary Austin, who he referred to as his common-law wife—and to whom he left the bulk of his vast estate. By 1986, rumors had begun swirling that Mercury was being treated for HIV. Despite constant inquiries, Mercury kept his battle with the illness a secret, denying his status to the press and telling the truth only to his closest family and friends. The rumors intensified after 1987, when Mercury began appearing increasingly more gaunt, and sporadically canceling and missing performances. His final music performance came in May 1991, when a wiry-thin Mercury appeared in Queen’s music video for the song “These Are The Days of Our Lives.” In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a virus that had previously appeared sporadically around the world began to spread throughout the United States. Originally identified as a “gay disease” because gay men were one of the primary groups afflicted, HIV and the syndrome it causes, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, were unknown in 1981 but […] Health officials first became aware of AIDS in the summer of 1981, but U.S. leaders remained largely silent for four years. During a time when fear and stigma around AIDS and LGBTQ identity were pervasive, Louganis kept his diagnosis secret until years later.

      "University of Notre Dame Church Life Journal A Journal of theMcGrath Institute for Church Life byNathan Bradford WilliamsFebruary 23, 2019 Bohemian Rhapsodyis not a very subtle movie. In the first moments of Bryan Singer’s Queen bio-drama, we get a montage of preparation for Live Aid, the famous 1985 all-star charity concert. The jorts-clad roadies move equipment, thousands of people make their way into Wembley Stadium, the members of the band wait in their trailer, guitars are tuned, costumes are donned, and Queen’s “Somebody to Love” plays on top of it all. Although we soon cut to fifteen years earlier and will not return to this time for another 90 minutes. The movie has successfully telegraphed to the audience: Live Aid is an important climax of this movie. As I said, not subtle. Much of this story is well-known, not only because of the popularity of Queen and Freddie Mercury (a Best Actor nominated Rami Malek), but because it is cliché. In 1970, four young British men form a band to rock on their own terms and for a different audience: “We’re four misfits who don’t belong together . . . playing for other misfits,” announces Freddie. Success comes soon, but strife is never far away from dividing Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon from their enormously talented and provocative singer Freddie Mercury. Despite the heights of fame and the lows of a life lived under a spotlight, the band pulls together for a selfless act of Rock and delivers what is widely considered one of the best live performances of all time. Throw in a soundtrack of Queen’s hits, knowing jokes for an audience raised on these lyrics, a cameo by Mike Myers (famously Queen-obsessed inWayne’s World),recording montages, touring montages, Freddie’s costumes montages, and an outsized set of dental prostheses for Malek and you haveBohemian Rhapsody. Indulge me for a moment, though, and return to the opening seconds of the film. Before any music starts, the shot lingers on one open eye of a mustachioed man, head on his pillow, face drawn, weary. He sits up and coughs, head hanging low. Extend your indulgence further, and hear my (purely speculative) opinion: withinBohemian Rhapsodyis a hypothetical movie, that one could extract and expand upon, titled (I’d like to think)Somebody to Love.This movie would strip away most of the repetitive tropes, the too-obvious lines, and the pastiche of Rock-god bravura (most and not all: some of it is quite fun). This movie (partially realized here) would tell the story of Freddie Mercury, a uniquely gifted singer, ambitious for fame, troubled by his latent homosexuality, and struggling to find something to like in himself. This movie would be aboutfriendship and real love, not its simulacra from adoring fans or from those whose own hurt makes them use and abuse people. Sure, this story is nothing groundbreakingly original, but it is one that resonates with the common human need for relationship, of the love that one can give when one knows that they are themselves loved. Freddie Mercury is a man in conflict: infatuated and (in some sort of) love with Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton), he struggles with his sexuality. From a traditional Parsi family, he struggles with the decision to pursue fame at the expense of alienating his parents. As Queen becomes more and more successful, Freddie’s outsized personality struggles against the checks on it necessary for creative collaboration with his bandmates. There is a darkness in Freddie’s life that keeps creeping in and cannot be stopped with distractions. Throw into this maelstrom Paul Prenter (Allen Leech), a part of Queen’s management team who soon ingratiates himself into Freddie’s life. “I know what it is like not to belong,” Paul say, himself “a queer Catholic boy from Belfast.” Paul invites Freddie to indulge in his misery, to share in a common animus against those who have kept them down. For moments, Freddie can forget about the emptiness inside with another and powerful distraction. The audience quickly sees that Paul is using Freddie, manipulating his pain and power to fill the void in his own life, keeping Freddie docilely dwindling down into a lower and lower hell of partying, promiscuity, drugs, drink, and despair. Finally, though, it is a word of love that Freddie hears when he is at his lowest. In a scene at once over the top and sincerely moving, Mary reminds Freddie that there are those who love him, not for anything that he has done, not for any fame or money he has, but for who he is. This realization that he is loved gives Freddie courage to cast off Paul, whom he refers to as a “fruit fly”—someone who has fed off of Freddie’s own sense of rottenness. He returns to the band, honest about his past mistakes, and is welcomed with open arms. Finding now that he actually likes something about himself (that he is loved), Freddie introduces Jim Hutton (who would become Mercury’s companion until the singer’s 1991 AIDS-related death, played by Aaron McCusker) to his parents before Live Aid. Malek speaks the truest words of the film, and ones that demonstrate its heart: “He’s my friend.” Bohemian Rhapsody(the film we get) more often than not opts for the sparks with no flame and the built-up, directionless emotion of a rock concert rather than the moments of clarity, well-expressed lyric, and human pathos that occasionally occur. In this way, the movie is something like Queen: a talented leading man (Mercury himself, Malek as Mercury) and a band who can rouse millions to sing along the problematic “No time for losers, ‘cause we are the champions!” can also give voice to waking each morning and dying a bit, desiring “someone to love.” Like Malek’s nearly flawless physical impression of Mercury, the film shows Queen mostly as we, the public, have seen them (including a full shot-by-shot Live Aid performance). In a few moments, however, we see an oft-told and worth repeating story of thevirtue of friendship. Editorial Statement: In anticipation of the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, we presented a series exploring the philosophical and theological elements in each of the eight films nominated for Best Picture. We hope to convey through this series that, awards politics and Hollywood scandals aside, films are an art form, and art matters to the Christian life. It allows us to locate the narratives we see onscreen—along with the narratives of our own lives—within the context of the narrative of salvation history, of God’s love poured forth in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

You will learn more about the singer's relationship with Montreux through photos, anecdotes and fascinating stories. An extended version of the Freddie Tour, a 2.5-hour experience to discover even more significant places connected to Freddie Mercury. Enjoy an enriched itinerary with more stories, rare photos, and unique anecdotes. Queen's four musicians (Freddie Mercury, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor) are regular visitors to the Swiss Riviera. Their first visit dates to July 1978: the group Queen had just finished the tour of the album \"News of the World\" and chose the famousMountain Studiosin Montreux to record its successor. This seventh LP was to be entitled Jazz. The Montreux experience was so productive that Queen took advantage of an unexpected opportunity to buy the Mountain Studios, whose premises were in theMontreux Casino. The group became the owners in 1979, one year after the recording of Jazz. The British quartet took advantage of this opportunity to work on the mixing of Live Killers, a live album recorded in the spring of 1979 during their European tour. Offering a synthesis of Queen's first seven releases, this live album was released in June of the same year. Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on 5 September 1946 in Stone Town, Zanzibar protectorate in southern Africa. His parents, Jer and Bomi Bulsara, were civil servants working for the British colonial office. His younger sister Kashmira was born when he was 7 years old. Farrokh Bulsara spent his school years in India where he began to learn to play the piano. At the age of 12, he joined a local rock band where he became a pianist. Farrokh decided to change his first name and chose Freddie, a nickname frequently used by his classmates. At the age of 17, he returned to Zanzibar to join his parents. The family left the Tanzanian archipelago in a hurry a year later because of the violent revolution that had broken out. The Bulsara family took refuge in 1964 in Feltham, a suburb in the west of London, not far from Heathrow airport where he later worked. Between 1966 and 1970, Freddie joined various local bands as a singer, each of which became more and more famous. A few years later, the musicians decided to abandon the name Smile in favour of Queen. The membership of this legendary and internationally known band would remain the same until Freddie Mercury's death 20 years later. The golden era between Queen and Montreux lasted from 1978 to 1995. Six studio albums were the result and offered history some of its greatest rock songs. The collection of albums recorded in Montreux were \"Jazz\" in 1978, \"Hot Space\" in 1982, \"A Kind of Magic\" in 1986, \"The Miracle\" in 1989, and \"Innuendo\" in 1991, which is the last studio recording in Freddie Mercury's lifetime. Then in 1995 came \"Made in Heaven\", Queen's 15th album, produced with the vocal parts recorded by the singer before his death. The relationship between Queen and Montreux has known its ups and downs, but it was especially the beginning that was difficult. Musicians who were used to the big London parties were quickly bored in the small seaside resort at the foot of the Swiss Alps in the canton of Vaud. But they soon realized, and Freddie Mercury in particular, that Montreux was able to offer them, far from the invading tumult of the media and the fans, the quietude necessary to write new songs. \"If you want peace of mind, come to Montreux\" Freddie Mercury said to his friend Montserrat Caballé, with whom he recorded the famous song \"Barcelona\" at the end of the 80s. This song, which reflects Freddie Mercury's love of opera, became the official anthem of the Catalan Olympic Games in 1992. From 1987, Freddie Mercury gradually became attached to the area, so much so that he finally decided to divide his life between the Garden Lodge, his main London residence, and Montreux. Freddie Mercury first lived in rented villas, then in a luxury hotel in which he became a regular guest, before finally acquiring a flat in 1991. By then he knew he was seriously ill and more than ever was looking for the peace and serenity that the region offered. It was while contemplating the lake and the mountains from his new Montreusian base that he was inspired to write the lyrics for A Winter's Tale. This song is an ode to the city of Montreux. It will appear on the posthumous album \"Made in Heaven\", released in 1995. Excerpt from the lyrics of \"A Winter's Tale\" So quiet and peaceful Tranquil and blissful There's a kind of magic in the air What a truly magnificent view A breathtaking scene At the beginning of 1991, when the album Innuendo had just been released, Freddie Mercury felt that he was losing the fight he had been waging against AIDS since 1987. He devoted himself, body and soul, to composition and very regularly invests in theMountains Studioin Montreux. He felt his time was running out and guessed that he might not be able to complete a new album in his lifetime. His only obsession was then to record as much material as possible to allow the three other members of Queen (Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon) to finish the arrangement work after his death. After Freddie Mercury's death on November 24, 1991, Brian, Roger and John took a few years before resuming work on what would become Queen's final album. They then returned to Montreux to finish the songs they had started a few years earlier. Always accompanied by David Richards at the Mountain Studios, they tirelessly rearranged every part of each song, until they reached the masterpiece that is Made in Heaven. Made In Heaven reached number one in the British charts as soon as it was released. The posthumous album went five times platinum with more than 20 million sales worldwide. The cover of this last Queen album is a view of the mountains and lake that Freddie loved to contemplate from the windows of his Montreux penthouse. Since 2001, the Freddie Celebration Days have been organized in Montreux by theMontreux CelebrationAssociation. This major and entirely free event takes place around 5 September, Freddie Mercury's birthday. TheFreddie Toursare organized by Lucien Muller, president of the Montreux Celebration association and have been offering guided tours in Montreux since 2020. These visits will allow you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the years when Freddie Mercury and Queen used to stay in Montreux. www.montreuxcelebration.com In 2018,Bohemian Rhapsodywas released. The biopic devoted to Freddie Mercury generated millions of dollars in revenue worldwide. The film was nominated for Best Picture and its actor Rami Malek, who plays the role of the famous singer was crowned Best Actor at the Hollywood Oscars. Bohemian Rhapsody also won Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing. The film, which allowed itself some freedom in terms of its screenplay, did however benefit from the support and supervision of Queen's two historical members, guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Their manager, Jim Beach, was also actively involved in its development. Bohemian Rhapsody concludes with the band's famous 1985 performance at the legendary \"Live Aid\" concert at Wembley Stadium. Freddie Mercury was then at the peak of his art and career. Small anecdote, in 1975, their record company EMI refused to release a single of the famous song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which they felt was too long. The title song was indeed 6 minutes long, well beyond the industry standards at the time. It had also been considered too strange, with its many changes of rhythm and its chorus which at the time was described as psychedelic. However, this track from the album \"A Night at The Opera\" suddenly made its comeback on the charts. By the end of 2018, Bohemian Rhapsody became the most played song of the 21th century with more than 1.6 billion online plays to date. Since the release of the film Bohemian Rhapsody, an increasing number of tourists and fans of the singer come to admire the famousbronze statue of Freddie Mercury. Inaugurated in 1996 in Montreux, it is the pride of Montreux residents and allows fans from all over the world to come and meditate and show respect in this very special place.

      "Down a small, narrow alley in the historic Stone Town neighborhood of Zanzibar, an old building beckons to visitors. Faded photographs are pinned outside the door while inside, a gallery of glossy pictures and old newspaper clippings lead the way to the room’s centerpiece: a black piano with an interesting history. A young Zanzibari boy once played that piano. His name was Farrokh Bulsara, but you probably know him better as Freddie Mercury. The flamboyant frontman of British rock bandQueen, Mercury was born in Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous island off the coast of Tanzania. This museum is dedicated to his memory. A melting pot of cultures and traditions, Zanzibar is known for its sunsets and spices, and has grown in popularity as a tourist destination since Stone Town was declared aUNESCO World Heritage Sitein 2000. In the wake of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the hit 2018 film that earnedRami Malek an Academy Awardfor his portrayal of Mercury, the late singer’s popularity here is also on the rise. Zanzibari businessman Javed Jafferji is co-owner of theFreddie Mercury Museum. Jafferji was a college student in London in the mid-1980s when he first became a fan. “At that time, not many people knew [Mercury] was from Zanzibar,” he says. Even today, many people don’t know about Mercury’s Zanzibari roots, says Jafferji. His goal is to put Stone Town on the rock history map. London street named for Freddie Mercury Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5, 1946, in Stone Town. The Bulsara family were Parsis from India – followers of Zoroastrianism, an ancient Persian religion. It is believed that young Farrokh first started singing in the town’s Zoroastrian Temple when he was a child. At the time, there were some 300 members of the Parsi community in Zanzibar. Today, only a handful remain, and the temple has long been abandoned. Mercury spent most of his childhood in Zanzibar, and attended boarding school in India. In the early 1960s, his family moved to the UK. Less than a decade later, Mercury formed Queen – and went on to attain rock legend status. He never returned to his birthplace. In 2002, Jafferji opened a small souvenir shop called The Mercury House in a former home of the Bulsara family. “I realized that there’s history behind this building,” he says. Nearly two decades later, the release of the movie “Bohemian Rhapsody” inspired Jafferji to think big. A surprise visit to Zanzibar by Queen guitarist Brian May sealed the deal. “[May] took a picture outside the building and [posted it] on his Instagram page,” says Jafferji. A post shared by Brian Harold May (@brianmayforreal) Jafferji and his friend Andrea Boero, also a Mercury fan, partnered with Queen Productions Ltd. in the UK to convert The Mercury House into a museum, chronicling Mercury’s early years in Zanzibar. The museum opened on November 24, 2019, the 28th anniversary of Mercury’s death. However, in March, the coronavirus pandemic struck, and the museum had to close. They also had to postpone the launch of the Mercury Tour, a guided walking tour to spots in Stone Town where Mercury spent his childhood. Inside Zanzibar's 'Burkini island' where Muslim girls learn to swim Despite the setback, Jafferji and his team are optimistic about the future. “We really want to create awareness of Freddie Mercury in Zanzibar and in Tanzania overall,” says Anam Adnan, general manager of the museum. “We want people to celebrate him and to love him.” But celebrating Freddie Mercury in Zanzibar is complicated. Had Mercury returned there later in life, he would have likely struggled to gain acceptance in a predominantly Muslim community wherehomosexuality is illegal. “We haven’t put much attention to his personal life because that’s a controversial topic for Zanzibaris,” says Adnan. Instead, she says, the museum focuses on Mercury’s music and his art. “It’s the biggest tribute that we, as Zanzibaris, can do for him.” © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "Sep 05, 2011 From time to time we invite guests to post about items of interest and are thrilled to have Brian May join us to talk about friend and bandmate Freddie Mercury.Our doodle celebrating Freddie's birthday can be seen around the world on September 5 and, out of respect for Labor Day, in the U.S. on September 6.A guitarist and songwriter, Brian May is a founding member of Queen and wrote many of the band’s hits, including “We Will Rock You,” “The Show Must Go On” and “I Want It All.” Brian is also a respected solo artist and one of the founders of Freddie for a Day (www.freddieforaday.com), an organization helping to fight HIV/AIDS globally. - Ed.I was first introduced to Freddie Mercury—a paradoxically shy yet flamboyant young man—at the side of the stage at one of our early gigs as the group “SMILE.” He told me he was excited by how we played, he had some ideas—and he could sing! I'm not sure we took him very seriously, but he did have the air of someone who knew he was right. He was a frail but energised dandy, with seemingly impossible dreams and a wicked twinkle in his eye. A while later we had the opportunity to actually see him sing ... and it was scary! He was wild and untutored, but massively charismatic. Soon, he began his evolution into a world-class vocal talent, right in front of our eyes.Freddie was fully focused, never allowing anything or anyone to get in the way of his vision for the future. He was truly a free spirit. There are not many of these in the world. To achieve this, you have to be, like Freddie, fearless—unafraid of upsetting anyone's apple cart.Some people imagine Freddie as the fiery, difficult diva who required everyone around him to compromise. No. In our world, as four artists attempting to paint on the same canvas, Freddie was always the one who could find the compromise—the way to pull it through. If he found himself at odds with any one of us, he would quickly dispel the cloud with a generous gesture, a wisecrack or an impromptu present. I remember one morning after a particularly tense discussion he presented me with a cassette. He had been up most of the night compiling a collage of my guitar solos. \"I wanted you to hear them as I hear them, dear,\" he said. \"They're all fab, so I made them into a symphony!\"To create with Freddie was always stimulating to the max. He was daring, always sensing a way to get outside the box. Sometimes he wastoofar out ... and he'd usually be the first to realise it. With a conspiratorial smile he would say \"Oh ... did I lose it, dears?!\" But usually there was sense in his nonsense—art in his madness. It was liberating. I think he encouraged us all in his way, to believe in our own madness, and the collective mad power of the group Queen.Freddie would have been 65 this year, and even though physically he is not here, his presence seems more potent than ever. Freddie made the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected. He gave people proof that a man could achieve his dreams—made them feel that through him they were overcoming their own shyness, and becoming the powerful figure of their ambitions. And he lived life to the full. He devoured life. He celebrated every minute. And, like a great comet, he left a luminous trail which will sparkle for many a generation to come.Happy birthday, Freddie!Posted by Dr. Brian May, CBE. Guitarist.About the CreativeWorking on this doodle for Freddie Mercury's birthday was an absolutely blast. Not only did I have a great team of animators, illustrators, and engineer, I was also working with the fantastic Queen classic, \"Don't Stop Me Now.\" The development of this 90 second tribute took about 4 months-- most of which went into planning the visual style of the doodle. Below are some of the illustrations (costume styles and color keys) I created to help guide my team in the color and quirky style that ultimately made it to the Google homepage.posted byJennifer Hom No results found.
