      "Bij een zware aardbeving in de buurt van de Tibetaanse stad Shigatse zijn in de nacht van maandag op dinsdag bijna honderd doden gevallen. Volgens de Chinese geologische dienst CENC ging het om een beving met een magnitude van 6.8. In de buurt van het epicentrum in Tingri zijn veel gebouwen ingestort. Vanuit die regio worden reizen naar de Mount Everest in de Himalaya georganiseerd. 's Werelds hoogste berg is zowel zuidelijk vanuit Nepal als noordelijk via Tibet te beklimmen. Tibet is een autonome regio in het zuidwesten van China. Shigatse is met naar schatting 800.000 inwoners de tweede stad van Tibet. De stad is bekend van het Tashilhunpo-klooster, de zetel van de p√§nchen lama. Dat is na de dalai lama de hoogste spirituele leider van het Tibetaanse boeddhisme. Het zuidwesten van China wordt vaker geteisterd door aardbevingen. In 2008 werd in de Chinese provincie Sichuan een beving met een kracht van 7.9 gemeten, die meer dan 80.000 mensen het leven kostte. In 2015 werd Nepal opgeschrikt door een aardbeving met een kracht van 7.8. Daarbij kwamen naar schatting negenduizend mensen om het leven.

      "[[ Freddie Mercury(bornFarrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946¬†‚Äì 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock bandQueen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octavevocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen. Born in 1946 inZanzibartoParsi-Indianparents, Mercury attended British boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled theZanzibar Revolution, moving toMiddlesex, England. Having previously studied and written music, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitaristBrian Mayand drummerRoger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985Live Aidconcert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and was posthumously featured on their final album,Made in Heaven(1995). In 1991, the day after publicly announcing his diagnosis,he diedfrom  complications of the disease at the age of 45. In 1992,a concert in tribute to himwas held atWembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 2001, theSongwriters Hall of Famein 2003, and theUK Music Hall of Famein 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members received theBrit AwardforOutstanding Contribution to British Music. One year after his death, Mercury received the same award individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded anIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in theBBC's poll of the100 Greatest Britons. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara inStone Townin theBritish protectorateofZanzibar(now part ofTanzania) on 5 September 1946.[2][3]His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara,[a][4]were from theParsicommunity of western India. The Bulsaras had origins in the city of Bulsar (nowValsad) inGujarat.[b][2]He had a younger sister, Kashmira (b. 1952).[5][6][7] The family had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at theBritish Colonial Office. As Parsis, the Bulsaras practisedZoroastrianism.[8]Mercury was born with fourextra incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range.[9][10]As Zanzibar was a British protectorate until 1963, Mercury was born aBritish subject, and on 2 June 1969 was registered acitizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesafter the family had emigrated to England.[11] Mercury spent most of his childhood in India where he began taking piano lessons at the age of seven while living with relatives.[12]In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study atSt. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, inPanchganinearBombay.[13]Inheriting his father's interest inphilately, between 9 and 12 years old Mercury collected stamps, many of which were from the British Commonwealth.[14]One of the rare personal possessions of Mercury in museum ownership, his stamp album is displayed in the collection of thePostal Museumin London.[14]At the age of 12, he formed a school band,the Hectics, and coveredrock and rollartists such asCliff RichardandLittle Richard.[15][16]One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said \"the only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music\".[17]A friend recalls that he had \"an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano\".[18]It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself \"Freddie\". In February 1963, he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.[19] In the spring of 1964, Mercury and his family fled to England from Zanzibar to escape the violence of therevolutionagainst theSultan of Zanzibarand his mainly Arab government,[20]in which thousands of ethnic Arabs and Indians were killed.[21]They moved to 19 Hamilton Close,Feltham,Middlesex, a town 13 miles (21¬†km) west of central London. The Bulsaras briefly relocated to 122 Hamilton Road, before settling into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue in late October.[22]After first studying art atIsleworth PolytechnicinWest London, Mercury studied graphic art and design atEaling Art College, graduating with a diploma in 1969.[23]He later used these skills to design heraldic arms for his band Queen.[24] Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand Edwardian clothes and scarves inKensington Marketin London withRoger Taylor. Taylor recalls, \"Back then, I didn't really know him as a singer‚Äîhe was just my mate. My crazy mate! If there was fun to be had, Freddie and I were usually involved.\"[25]He also held a job as a baggage handler atHeathrow Airport.[26]Other friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man with a great interest in music.[27]In 1969, he joinedLiverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage, which played \"veryHendrix-style, heavy blues\".[28]He briefly lived in a flat above the Dovedale Towers, a pub onPenny Lanein Liverpool'sMossley Hilldistrict.[29][30]When this band failed to take off, he joined anOxford-based band,Sour Milk Sea, but by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.[31] In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitaristBrian Mayand drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their bandSmile.[23]They were joined by bassistJohn Deaconin 1971. Despite the reservations of the other members andTrident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name \"Queen\" for the new band. He later said, \"It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.\"[32]At about the same time, he legallychanged his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.[33] Shortly before the release of Queen'sself-titled first album, Mercury designed the band's logo, known as the \"Queen crest\".[24]The logo combines thezodiacsigns of the four band members: two lions for Deacon and Taylor (signLeo), a crab for May (Cancer), and two fairies for Mercury (Virgo).[24]The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.[24]A crown is shown inside the Q, and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormousphoenix. The Queen crest bears a passing resemblance to theRoyal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.[24] Although Mercury's speaking voice naturally fell in thebaritonerange, he delivered most songs in thetenorrange.[34]His known vocal range extended frombasslow F (F2) tosopranohigh F (F6).[35]He couldbeltup totenorhigh F (F5).[35]BiographerDavid Bretdescribed his voice as \"escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfectcoloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches\".[36]SpanishsopranoMontserrat Caball√©, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that \"the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice\".[37]She adds: His technique was astonishing. No problem oftempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.[35] The Wholead singerRoger Daltreydescribed Mercury as \"the best virtuoso rock 'n' roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that's an art. And he was brilliant at it.\"[38]Discussing what type of person he wanted to play thelead rolein his musicalJesus Christ Superstar,Andrew Lloyd Webbersaid: \"He has to be of enormous charisma, but he also has to be a genuine, genuine rock tenor. That's what it is. Really think Freddie Mercury, I mean that's the kind of range we're talking about.\"[39] A research team undertook a study in 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice.[40]Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably fastervibratoand use ofsubharmonicsas unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers.[41]The research team studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, and a series of interviews of the late artist. They also used anendoscopicvideo camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.[41][42] Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen'sGreatest Hitsalbum: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Bicycle Race\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\", \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", and \"Play the Game\".[43]In 2003 Mercury was posthumously inducted into theSongwriters Hall of Famewith the rest of Queen, and in 2005 all four band members were awarded anIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[44][45] The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles,rockabilly,progressive rock,heavy metal,gospel, anddisco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, \"I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things.\"[46]Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is non-cyclical in structure and comprises dozens ofchords.[47][48]He also wrote six songs fromQueen IIwhich deal with multiple key changes and complex material. \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Although Mercury often wrote very intricateharmonies, he said that he could barely read music.[49]He composed most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of key signatures.[47] Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd.[50]A writer forThe Spectatordescribed him as \"a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself.\"[51]David Bowie, who performed at theFreddie Mercury Tribute Concertand recorded the song \"Under Pressure\" with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: \"Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest¬†... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.\"[52]Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make \"the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected\".[53]Mercury's main prop on stage was a brokenmicrophone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless ways.[54] One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took place atLive Aidin 1985.[23]Queen's performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music. The results were aired on a television program called \"The World's Greatest Gigs\".[55][56]Mercury's powerful, sustained note during thea cappellasection came to be known as \"The Note Heard Round the World\".[57][58]In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, \"Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots toMick Jagger,Robert Plant, etc. all are guilty of a terrible oversight. Freddie, as evidenced by hisDionysianLive Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all.\"[59]PhotographerDenis O'Regan, who captured a definitive pose of Mercury on stage‚Äîarched back, knee bent and facing toward the sky‚Äîduring his final tour with Queen in 1986, commented \"Freddie was a once-in-a-lifetime showman\".[60]Queen roadie Peter Hince states, \"It wasn't just about his voice but the way he commanded the stage. For him it was all about interacting with the audience and knowing how to get them on his side. And he gave everything in every show.\"[50] Throughout his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved.[46]He once explained, \"We're theCecil B. DeMilleof rock and roll, always wanting to do things bigger and better.\"[46]The band was the first ever to play in South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in theMorumbi Stadiumin S√£o Paulo in 1981.[61]In 1986, Queen also played behind theIron Curtainwhen they performed to a crowd of 80,000 inBudapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe.[62]Mercury'sfinal live performancewith Queen took place on 9 August 1986 atKnebworth Parkin England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 200,000.[63]A week prior to Knebworth, May recalled Mercury saying \"I'm not going to be doing this forever. This is probably the last time.\"[63]With the British national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" playing at the end of the concert, Mercury's final act on stage saw him draped in a robe, holding a golden crown aloft, bidding farewell to the crowd.[64][65] As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time werethe Who,the Beatles,Jimi Hendrix,David Bowie, andLed Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. Brian May said that Mercury \"had a wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him like nobody else ‚Äì incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling.\"[66]KeyboardistRick Wakemanpraised Mercury's playing style, saying he \"discovered [the piano] for himself\" and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument.[67]From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlistedFred Mandel(a Canadian musician who also worked forPink Floyd,Elton John, andSupertramp) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg),[68]and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated withMike Moran(in the studio) andSpike Edney(in concert).[69] Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including \"Killer Queen\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Somebody to Love\", and \"Don't Stop Me Now\". He used concertgrand pianos(such as aBechstein) and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as theharpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Brian May said that Mercury used the piano less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience.[70][71]Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.[72] As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of theUK Music Charts. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonymLarry Lurex, whenTrident Studios' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs \"I Can Hear Music\" and \"Goin' Back\", both were released together as a single in 1973.[1]Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927Fritz LangfilmMetropolis. The song\"Love Kills\"was written for the film byGiorgio Moroderin collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder andMack; in 1984 it debuted at the number 10 position in theUK Singles Chart.[73] I won't be touring on my own or splitting up with Queen. Without the others I would be nothing. The press always makes out that I'm the wild one and they're all quiet, but it's not true. I've got some wild stories about Brian May you wouldn't believe. Mercury's two full albums outside the band wereMr. Bad Guy(1985) andBarcelona(1988).[23]His first album,Mr. Bad Guy, debuted in the top ten of theUK Album Charts.[73]In 1993, a remix of \"Living on My Own\", a single from the album,posthumously reached number oneon theUK Singles Charts. The song also garnered Mercury a posthumousIvor Novello Awardfrom theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.[75]AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describesMr. Bad Guyas \"outstanding from start to finish\" and expressed his view that Mercury \"did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory\".[76] His second album,Barcelona, recorded with SpanishsopranovocalistMontserrat Caball√©, combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as \"the most bizarre CD of the year\".[77]The album was a commercial success,[78]and thealbum's title trackdebuted at No.¬†8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain.[79]The title track received massive airplay as the official anthem of the1992 Summer Olympics(held inBarcelonaone year after Mercury's death). Caball√© sang it live at the opening of the Olympics with Mercury's part played on a screen, and again before the start of the1999 UEFA Champions League FinalbetweenManchester UnitedandBayern Munichin Barcelona.[80] In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own version of the hit \"The Great Pretender\" bythe Platters, which debuted at No.¬†5 in the UK in 1987.[73]In September 2006 a compilation album featuring Mercury's solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his 60th birthday. The album debuted in the UK top 10.[81]In 2012,Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender, a documentary film directed byRhys Thomason Mercury's attempts to forge a solo career, premiered onBBC One.[82] In 1986, Mercury recorded two songs forDave Clark'sWest Endsci-fi musicalTime. Mercury performedthe title songand Clark played it toLaurence Olivierwho starred as the hologram Akash in a pre-filmed segment for the musical in what was one of his last roles, with Clark recalling: \"Laurence Olivier was a huge god of an actor. He narrated the album [Time], and, when Freddie came on, singing \"Time\", Olivier said, 'Now, my dear boy,there'san actor.'\" Clark relayed the reaction of Olivier to Mercury: \"I told Freddie and he was over the moon. I arranged for a dinner party at my place, Olivier came along and they got on like a house on fire.\"[83] Between 1981 and 1983 Mercury recorded several tracks withMichael Jackson, including a demo of \"State of Shock\", \"Victory\", and \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\".[84][85]None of these collaborations were officially released at the time, althoughbootlegrecordings exist. Jackson went on to record the single \"State of Shock\" withMick Jaggerforthe Jacksons' albumVictory.[86]Mercury included the solo version of \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\" on hisMr. Bad Guyalbum.[87]\"There Must Be More to Life Than This\" was eventually reworked by Queen and released on their compilation albumQueen Foreverin 2014.[88]Mercury andRoger Taylorsang on the title track forBilly Squier's 1982 studio release,Emotions in Motionand later contributed to two tracks on Squier's 1986 release,Enough Is Enough, providing vocals on \"Love is the Hero\" and musical arrangements on \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\".[89]In 2020, Mercury's music video for \"Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\" was nominated for Best Animation at theBerlin Music Video Awards. Woodlock studio is behind the animation.[90] In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. Austin, born inFulham, London, met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 and he was 23 years old, a year before Queen had formed.[91]He lived with Austin for several years inWest Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive atElektra Records. In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship.[69]Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, and bought Austin a place of her own near his new address of 12 Stafford Terrace, Kensington.[92] Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years; Mercury often referred to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, he said of Austin: \"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was mycommon-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.\"[93]Mercury's final home,Garden Lodge, an 8-bedroomGeorgianmansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, was picked out by Austin.[94]Austin married the painting artist Piers Cameron; they have two children. Mercury was the godfather of her older son, Richard.[70]In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, having told her, \"You would have been my wife, and it would have been yours anyway.\"[95] From 1979 to 1985, while living inMunich, Mercury was friends with Austrian actressBarbara Valentin, who is featured in the video for \"It's a Hard Life\", and initially lived together with her and her daughter before moving into his own apartment.[96][97]In Munich, Mercury was able to escape the media spotlight, lived out his sexuality, drifted in the local gay scene, and had an intense love relationship with German restaurateur Winfried \"Winnie\" Kirchberger.[96][98][99]Mercury also lived temporarily at Kirchberger's apartment[100]and thanked him \"for board and lodging\" in the liner notes of his 1985 albumMr. Bad Guy.[101]He wore a silver wedding band given to him by Kirchberger.[102]A close friend described him as Mercury's \"great love\" in Germany.[103] By 1985, he began another long-term relationship, with Irish-born hairdresser Jim Hutton (1949‚Äì2010) whom he referred to as his husband.[104]Mercury described their relationship as one built on solace and understanding, and said that he \"honestly couldn't ask for better\".[105]Hutton, who testedHIV-positivein 1990, lived with Mercury for the last seven years of his life, nursed him during his illness, and was present at his bedside when he died. Mercury wore a gold wedding band, given to him by Hutton in 1986, until the end of his life. He was cremated with it on.[102]Hutton later relocated from London to the bungalow he and Mercury had built for themselves in Ireland.[102] Radio disc jockeyKenny Everettmet Mercury in 1974, when he invited the singer onto hisCapital Londonbreakfast show.[106]As two of Britain's most flamboyant, outrageous and popular entertainers, they shared much in common and became close friends.[106]In 1975, Mercury visited Everett, bringing with him an advance copy of the single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[94]Despite doubting that any station would play the six-minute track, Everett placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, exclaimed: \"Forget it, it's going to be number one for centuries\".[94]Although Capital Radio had not officially accepted the song, Everett talked incessantly about a record he possessed but could not play. He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: \"Oops, my finger must've slipped.\"[94]On one occasion, Everett aired the song fourteen times over a single weekend.[107]Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.[106][108] During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett's confidant.[106]Throughout the early-to-mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and use drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together.[106]By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wifeLee Everett Alkin.[106]In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.[106] Mercury saw the stage version of the London musicalThe Rocky Horror Showat theRoyal Court TheatreinChelsea, and in 1975 went to see thefilm version, both of which starredTim Curry. Curry and Mercury became friends, and as a keen horticulturalist Curry later told the UK edition ofHouse And Gardenmagazine about designing Mercury's garden: \"Freddie came back from a tour and said, 'The garden, dear, it's dead.' I said, 'What? Did you water it?' And Freddie said, 'Water it, dear?'\"[109]Both Mercury and Curry were also close friends withPeter Straker; Straker, who first met Mercury at a London restaurant in November 1975, was a frequent diner at Mercury's home in Garden Lodge.[110] Mercury was a long-time friend ofElton John. Shortly before his own death in November 1991, Mercury ordered that a watercolour by John's favourite artist, the 19th-century English impressionist painterHenry Scott Tuke, be given to John on Christmas Day. In a 2021 interview, John recalled: \"Here was this beautiful man, dying from AIDS, and in his final days, he had somehow managed to find me a lovely Christmas present\".[111] While some commentators said Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public,[20][37][112]others said he was \"openlygay\".[113][114]In December 1974, when asked directly, \"So how about being bent?\" by theNew Musical Express, Mercury replied, \"You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further.\"[115]Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had beendecriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, seven years earlier. During public events in the 1980s, Mercury often kept a distance from his partner, Jim Hutton.[116] Mercury's flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance atWembley Arenain 1984 forKerrang!, noted Mercury's \"camp\" addresses to the audience and even described him as a \"posing, pouting, posturing tart\".[117]In 1992, John Marshall ofGay Timesopined: \"[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle'¬†... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement.\"[118]In an article forAfterElton, Robert Urban said: \"Mercury did not ally himself to 'politicaloutness,' or toLGBTQcauses.\"[118] Some believe Mercury was bisexual; for example, regarding the creation ofCelebrate Bisexuality Day,Wendy Currysaid: \"We were sitting around at one of the annual bi conventions, venting and someone¬†‚Äì I think it wasGigi‚Äì said we should have a party. We all loved the great bisexual, Freddie Mercury. His birthday was in September, so why not Sept? We wanted a weekend day to ensure the most people would do something. Gigi's birthday was September 23rd. It fell on a weekend day, so, poof! We had a day.\"[119][120]The Advocatesaid in May 2018, \"Closetedthroughout his life, Mercury, who was bisexual, engaged in affairs with men but referred to a woman he loved in his youth, Mary Austin, as 'the love of his life,' according to the biographySomebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury.\"[121]Additionally, according to an obituary Mercury was a \"self-confessed bisexual\".[122][123] The 2018 biopic of Mercury,Bohemian Rhapsody, received criticism for its portrayal of Mercury's sexuality, which was described as \"sterilized\" and \"confused\", and was even accused of being \"dangerous\".[124][125][126] Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well,[18][37]and granted very few interviews. He once said of himself: \"When I'm performing I'm anextrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man.\"[127]On this contrast to \"his larger-than-life stage persona\", BBC music broadcasterBob Harrisadds he was \"lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable.\"[128]While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience.NirvanafrontmanKurt Cobain's suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury \"seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd\".[129][130] Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, \"that's something inbred, it's a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persianpopinjay\",[131]an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background. Feeling a connection to Britain prior to arriving in England, the young Bulsara was heavily influenced by British fashion and music trends while growing up.[131]According to his longtime assistant Peter Freestone, \"if Freddie had his way, he would have been born aged 18 inFeltham.\"[131]Harris states, \"One of the things about Freddie was that he was very civilised and quite 'English'. I'd go over to his flat nearShepherd's Bushin the afternoon, and he'd get out the fine china and the sugar lumps and we'd have a cup of tea.\"[128]His flamboyant dress sense and the emergence ofglam rockin the UK in the early 1970s saw Mercury wear outfits designed byZandra Rhodes.[132] When asked byMelody Makerin 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, \"Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few.John Lennonwas one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people's thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between. People with mere talent, like me, have not got the ability or power.\"[133]Mercury dedicated a song to the former member ofthe Beatles. The song, \"Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)\", is included in the 1982 albumHot Space.[134]Mercury did occasionally express his concerns about the state of the world in his lyrics. His most notable \"message\" songs are \"Under Pressure\", \"Is This the World We Created...?\" (a song which Mercury and May performed at Live Aid, and also featured inGreenpeace ‚Äì The Album), \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\", \"The Miracle\" (a song May called \"one of Freddie's most beautiful creations\") and \"Innuendo\".[135][136] Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from theBlue Cross. Mercury \"placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life\", and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them. Mercury wrote a song for Delilah, \"his favourite cat of all\", which appeared on the Queen albumInnuendo.[137]Mercury dedicated his liner notes in his 1985 solo albumMr. Bad Guyto Jerry and his other cats. It reads, \"This album is dedicated to my cat Jerry‚Äîalso Tom, Oscar, and Tiffany and all the cat lovers across the universe‚Äîscrew everybody else!\"[138] In 1987, Mercury celebrated his 41st birthday at thePikes Hotel,Ibiza, Spain, several months after discovering that he had contracted HIV.[94]Mercury sought much comfort at the retreat and was a close friend of the owner, Anthony Pike, who described Mercury as \"the most beautiful person I've ever met in my life. So entertaining and generous.\"[139]According to biographerLesley-Ann Jones, Mercury \"felt very much at home there. He played some tennis, lounged by the pool, and ventured out to the odd gay club or bar at night.\"[110]The birthday party, held on 5 September 1987, has been described as \"the most incredible example of excess the Mediterranean island had ever seen\", and was attended by some 700 people.[140]A cake in the shape ofAntoni Gaudi'sSagrada Fam√≠liawas provided for the party. The original cake collapsed and was replaced with a two-metre-long sponge cake decorated with the notes from Mercury's song \"Barcelona\".[139]The bill, which included 232 broken glasses, was presented to Queen's manager,Jim Beach.[141]Before his death, Mercury had told Beach, \"You can do what you want with my music, but don't make me boring.\"[142] Mercury exhibitedHIV/AIDSsymptoms as early as 1982. Authors Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne have stated in their biographical book about Mercury,Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury, that Mercury secretly visited a doctor in New York City to get a white lesion on his tongue checked (which might have beenhairy leukoplakia, one of the first signs of an infection) a few weeks before Queen's final American appearance with Mercury onSaturday Night Liveon 25 September 1982, where he began to exhibit the symptoms of someone recently infected with HIV.[143] In October 1986, two months after Mercury's final live performance with Queen atKnebworth Houseon theMagic Tour, the British newspapers theNews of the WorldandThe Sunreported that Mercury had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at aHarley Streetclinic, but he was quoted as saying he was \"perfectly fit and healthy\".[145]According to his partner, Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late April 1987.[146]Around that time, Mercury said in an interview that he had tested negative for HIV.[37] The British press pursued rumours about Mercury's health over the next few years, fuelled by his increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring, and reports from his former lovers totabloid journalists. By 1990, rumours about Mercury's health were rife.[147]At the1990 Brit Awardsheld at theDominion Theatre, London, on 18 February, Mercury made his final appearance on stage, when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.[148][149] Mercury and his inner circle of colleagues and friends continually denied the stories. It has been suggested that Mercury could have helped AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his illness.[52][150]Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him; May later confirmed that Mercury had informed the band of his illness much earlier.[151][152]Filmed in May 1991, themusic videofor \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" features a very thin Mercury in his final scenes in front of the camera.[153]Director of the videoRudi Dolezalcomments, \"AIDS was never a topic. We never discussed it. He didn't want to talk about it. Most of the people didn't even 100 percent know if he had it, apart from the band and a few people in the inner circle. He always said, 'I don't want to put any burden on other people by telling them my tragedy.'\"[154]The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May said of Mercury: \"He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really.\"[144]Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, said: \"This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [Freddie] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [of his illness] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.'\"[144] After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home inKensington, West London. His former partner, Mary Austin, was a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last few weeks made regular visits to look after him.[155]Near the end of his life, Mercury began to lose his sight, and declined so that he was unable to leave his bed.[155]Mercury chose to hasten his death by refusing medication and took only painkillers.[155]On 22 November 1991, Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach to his Kensington home to prepare a public statement, which was released the following day:[151] Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with me, my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue. On the evening of 24 November 1991, about 24 hours after issuing the statement, Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington.[156]The cause of death wasbronchial pneumoniaresulting from AIDS.[157]His close friendDave Clarkofthe Dave Clark Fivewas at the bedside vigil when Mercury died.[158]Austin phoned Mercury's parents and sister to break the news, which reached newspaper and television crews in the early hours of 25 November.[159] Mercury's funeral service was conducted on 27 November 1991 by aZoroastrianpriest atWest London Crematorium, where he is commemorated by aplinthunder his birth name. In attendance at Mercury's service were his family and 35 of his close friends, includingElton Johnand the members of Queen.[160][161]His coffin was carried into the chapel to the sounds of \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\"/\"You've Got a Friend\" byAretha Franklin.[162]In accordance with Mercury's wishes, Mary Austin took possession of hiscremated remainsand buried them in an undisclosed location.[71]The whereabouts of his ashes are believed to be known only to Austin, who has said that she will never reveal them.[163]However, they are traditionally held by Queen fans to beKensal Green Cemetery, where the plinth marks the supposed burial location.[164] Mercury spent and donated to charity much of his wealth during his lifetime, with his estate valued around ¬£8¬†million at the time of his death. He bequeathed his home, Garden Lodge, and the adjoining Mews, as well as a 50% of all privately owned shares, to Mary Austin. His sister, Kashmira Cooke, received 25%, as did his parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, which Cooke acquired upon their deaths. He willed ¬£500,000 to Joe Fannelli; ¬£500,000 to Jim Hutton; ¬£500,000 to Peter Freestone; and ¬£100,000 to Terry Giddings.[165]Mercury, who never drove a car because he had no licence, was often chauffeured around London in hisRolls-Royce Silver Shadowfrom 1979 until his death. The car was passed to his sister Kashmira who made it available for display at public events, including the West End premiere of the musicalWe Will Rock Youin 2002, before it was auctioned off at theNECin Birmingham in 2013 for ¬£74,600.[166][167] Following his death, the outer walls of Garden Lodge inLogan Placebecame a shrine to Mercury, with mourners paying tribute by covering the walls in graffiti messages.[168]Three years laterTime Outmagazine reported that \"the wall outside the house has become London's biggest rock 'n' roll shrine\".[168]Fans continued to visit to pay their respects with letters appearing on the walls[169]until 2017, when Austin had the wall cleared.[170]Hutton was involved in a 2000 biography of Mercury,Freddie Mercury, the Untold Story, and also gave an interview forThe Timesin September 2006 for what would have been Mercury's 60th birthday.[146] The charisma and power in his performance style has over the years led to many artists quoting him as one of their biggest inspirations today. The diverse scope of artists that love Mercury is huge. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music,[172][173]Mercury was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octavevocal range.[174][175][176]He defied the conventions of a rock frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.[177] The extent to which Mercury's death may have enhanced Queen's popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen's popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death.[178]In 1992, one American critic noted, \"What cynics call the 'dead star' factor had come into play‚ÄîQueen is in the middle of a major resurgence.\"[179]The movieWayne's World, which featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", also came out in 1992.[180]According to theRecording Industry Association of America, Queen had sold 34.5¬†million albums in the United States by 2004, about half of which had been sold since Mercury's death in 1991.[181] Estimates of Queen's total worldwide record sales to date have been set as high as 300¬†million.[182]In the United Kingdom, Queen have now spent more collective weeks on theUK Album Chartsthan any other musical act (includingthe Beatles),[183]andQueen's Greatest Hitsis thebest-selling albumof all time in the United Kingdom.[184]Two of Mercury's songs, \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", have also each been voted as the greatest song of all time in major polls bySony Ericsson[185]andGuinness World Records.[186]Both songs have been inducted into theGrammy Hall of Fame; \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in 2004 and \"We Are the Champions\" in 2009.[187]In October 2007 the video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was voted the greatest of all time by readers ofQmagazine.[188] Since his death, Queen were inducted into theRock and Roll Hall of Famein 2001, and all four band members were inducted into theSongwriters Hall of Famein 2003.[189][190]Their Rock Hall of Fame citation reads, \"in the golden era ofglam rockand gorgeously hyper-produced theatrical extravaganzas that defined one branch of '70s rock, no group came close in either concept or execution to Queen.\"[191]The band were among the inaugural inductees into theUK Music Hall of Famein 2004. Mercury was individually posthumously awarded theBrit Awardfor Outstanding Contribution to British Music in 1992.[192]They received theIvor Novello Awardfor Outstanding Song Collection from theBritish Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authorsin 2005, and in 2018 they were presented theGrammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[45][193] In November 1995, Mercury appeared posthumously on Queen's final studio albumMade in Heaven.[23][194]The album featured Mercury's previously unreleased final recordings from 1991, as well as outtakes from previous years and reworked versions of solo works by the other members.[195]The album cover features the Freddie Mercury statue that overlooks Lake Geneva superimposed with Mercury's Duck House lake cabin that he had rented. This is where he had written and recorded his last songs atMountain Studios.[195]The sleeve of the album contains the words, \"Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury.\"[195] Featuring tracks such as \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\", the album also contains the song \"Mother Love\", the last vocal recording Mercury made before his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor, and Deacon later added the instrumental track.[196]After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he \"wasn't feeling that great\" and stated, \"I will finish it when I come back next time\". He never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.[144] A statue in Montreux, Switzerland, by sculptorIrena Sedleck√°, was erected as a tribute to Mercury.[197]It stands almost 10 feet (3.0 metres) high overlooking Lake Geneva and was unveiled on 25 November 1996 by Mercury's father and Montserrat Caball√©, with bandmates Brian May and Roger Taylor also in attendance.[198]Beginning in 2003 fans from around the world have gathered in Switzerland annually to pay tribute to the singer as part of the \"Freddie Mercury Montreux Memorial Day\" on the first weekend of September.[199] In 1997 the three remaining members of Queen released \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\", a song dedicated to Mercury and all those that die too soon.[200]In 1999 aRoyal Mailstamp with an image ofMercury on stagewas issued in his honour as part of the UK postal service'sMillennium Stampseries.[201][202]In 2009 a star commemorating Mercury was unveiled inFeltham, west London where his family moved upon arriving in England in 1964. The star in memory of Mercury's achievements was unveiled on Feltham High Street by his mother Jer Bulsara and Queen bandmate May.[203] A statue of Mercury stood over the entrance to theDominion Theatrein London'sWest Endfrom May 2002 to May 2014 for Queen andBen Elton's musicalWe Will Rock You.[204]A tribute to Queen was on display at theFremont Street Experienceindowntown Las Vegasthroughout 2009 on its video canopy.[205]In December 2009 a large model of Mercury wearingtartanwas displayed in Edinburgh as publicity for the run ofWe Will Rock You.[206]Sculptures of Mercury often feature him wearing a military jacket with his fist in the air. In 2018,GQcalled Mercury's yellow military jacket (created by British costume designer Diana Moseley) from his 1986 concerts his best known look,[207]whileCNNcalled it \"an iconic moment in fashion.\"[208] For Mercury's 65th birthday in 2011, Google dedicated itsGoogle Doodleto him. It included an animation set to his song, \"Don't Stop Me Now\".[209]Referring to \"the late, great Freddie Mercury\" in their 2012Rock and Roll Hall of Fameinduction speech,Guns N' Rosesquoted Mercury's lyrics from \"We Are the Champions\"; \"I've taken my bows, my curtain calls, you've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it, and I thank you all.\"[210][211] Tribute was paid to Queen and Mercury at theclosing ceremonyof the2012 Summer Olympicsin London. The band's performance of \"We Will Rock You\" withJessie Jwas opened with a video of Mercury's \"call and response\" routine from 1986's Wembley Stadium performance, with the 2012 crowd at theOlympic Stadiumresponding appropriately.[212][213]The frog genusMercurana, discovered in 2013 inKerala, India, was named as a tribute because Mercury's \"vibrant music inspires the authors\". The site of the discovery is very near to where Mercury spent most of his childhood.[214]In 2013, a newly discovered species ofdamselflyfrom Brazil was namedHeteragrion freddiemercuryi, honouring the \"superb and gifted musician and songwriter whose wonderful voice and talent still entertain millions\"¬†‚Äî one of four similar damselflies named after the Queen bandmates, in tribute to Queen's 40th anniversary.[215] On 1 September 2016, anEnglish Heritageblue plaquewas unveiled at Mercury's home in 22 Gladstone Avenue in Feltham, west London by his sister, Kashmira Cooke, and Brian May.[216]Attending the ceremony,Karen Bradley, the UKSecretary of State for Culture, called Mercury \"one of Britain's most influential musicians\", and added he \"is a global icon whose music touched the lives of millions of people around the world\".[217]On 24 February 2020 a street in Feltham was renamed Freddie Mercury Close during a ceremony attended by his sister Kashmira.[218]On 5 September 2016, the 70th anniversary of Mercury's birth, asteroid17473 Freddiemercurywas named after him.[219]Issuing the certificate of designation to the \"charismatic singer\", Joel Parker of theSouthwest Research Instituteadded: \"Freddie Mercury sang, 'I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky'¬†‚Äî and now that is even more true than ever before.\"[219]In an April 2019 interview, British rock concert promoterHarvey Goldsmithreferred to Mercury as \"one of our most treasured talents\".[220] In August 2019, Mercury was one of the honorees inducted in theRainbow Honor Walk, awalk of famein San Francisco'sCastro DistrictnotingLGBTQpeople who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".[221][222][223]Freddie Mercury Alley is a 107-yard-long (98¬†m) alley next to the British embassy in the Ujazd√≥w district inWarsaw, Poland, which is dedicated to Mercury, and was unveiled on 22 November 2019.[224]Until the Freddie Mercury Close in Feltham was dedicated, Warsaw was the only city in Europe with a street dedicated to the singer.[225][226]In January 2020, Queen became the first band to join Queen Elizabeth II on a British coin. Issued by theRoyal Mint, thecommemorative ¬£5 coinfeatures the instruments of all four band members, including Mercury'sBechsteingrand piano and his mic and stand.[227]In April 2022, a life-size statue of Mercury was unveiled in South Korea's resort island ofJeju.[228]In May 2024, the craterBulsaraon the planetMercurywas named after his birth name.[229] Mercury has featured in international advertising to represent the UK. In 2001, a parody of Mercury, along with prints of other British music icons consisting ofThe Beatles, Elton John,Spice Girls, andThe Rolling Stones, appeared in theEurostarnational advertising campaign in France for the Paris to London route.[230]In September 2017 the airlineNorwegianpainted the tail fin of two of its aircraft with a portrait of Mercury to mark what would have been his 71st birthday. Mercury is one of the company's six \"British tail fin heroes\", alongside England's1966 FIFA World Cupwinning captainBobby Moore, children's authorRoald Dahl, novelistJane Austen, pioneering pilotAmy Johnson, and aviation entrepreneur SirFreddie Laker.[231][232] \"Good evening Wembley and the world. We are here tonight to celebrate the life, and work, and dreams, of one Freddie Mercury. We're gonna give him the biggest send off in history!\" As the first major rock star to die of AIDS-related complications, Mercury's death represented an important event in the history of the disease.[234]In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen foundedThe Mercury Phoenix Trustand organisedThe Freddie Mercury Tribute Concertfor AIDS Awareness, to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research, which took place on 20 April 1992.[235]The Mercury Phoenix Trust has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities.

For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC.[242]He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes.[243]Although he had been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his bookThe Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present.[244]In 2008,Rolling Stoneranked Mercury 18 on itsTop 100 Singers Of All Time.[175]Mercury was voted the greatest male singer inMTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music.[113]In 2011 aRolling Stonereaders' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.[129]Billboardmagazine placed him second on their25 Best Rock Frontmen (and Women) of All Timelist in 2015,[245]and third on their50 Greatest Rock Lead Singers of All Timelist in 2023.[246]In 2016,LA Weeklyranked him first on the list of 20 greatest singers of all time, in any genre.[247]In 2023,Rolling Stoneranked Mercury at No. 14 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[248] On 24 November 1997, amonodramaabout Freddie Mercury's life, titledMercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God, opened in New York City.[249]It presented Mercury in the hereafter: examining his life, seeking redemption and searching for his true self.[250]The play was written and directed byCharles Messinaand the part of Mercury was played byKhalid Gon√ßalves(n√© Paul Gon√ßalves) and then later,Amir Darvish.[251]Billy Squieropened one of the shows with an acoustic performance of a song he had written about Mercury titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\".[252] In 2016 a musical titledRoyal Vauxhallpremiered at theRoyal Vauxhall Tavernin Vauxhall, London. Written byDesmond O'Connor, the musical told the alleged tales of the nights that Mercury, Kenny Everett andPrincess Dianaspent out at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London in the 1980s.[253]Following several successful runs in London, the musical was taken to theEdinburgh Fringe Festivalin August 2016 starring Tom Giles as Mercury.[253] The 2018 biographical filmBohemian Rhapsodywas, at its release, the highest-grossingmusicalbiographical film of all time.[254][255]Mercury was portrayed byRami Malek, who received theAcademy Award,BAFTA Award,Golden Globe AwardandScreen Actors Guild Awardfor Best Actor, for his performance.[256][257]While the film received mixed reviews and contained historical inaccuracies, it won the Golden Globe forBest Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama.[258][259][260] Mercury appeared as a supporting character in the BBC television dramaBest Possible Taste: TheKenny EverettStory, first broadcast in October 2012.

      "[[ *Image from a drawing I bought at an art fair that hangs in my office, artist‚Äôs name illegible I think it was Lou Reed, on a song from his landmark late-80s albumNew York,who sang about the ‚Äúduality of nature, human nature, godly nature splits the soul.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure I knew what he was talking about when I was listening to that song in my car on cassette, driving around Northwest Arkansas. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve started to piece that together a little better. For example, on a superficial level, I can tell you that autumn is my favorite time year (‚Äúautumn‚Äôs sweet, we call it fall‚Äù as the Chili Peppers sang). At the same time I can tell you that I hate this time of year. The faceless corporation I work for does most of it‚Äôs business in December so autumn and early winter are always insanely busy. My travel goes up, my time to listen to rock and roll goes down. The only thing that throws the balance of autumn to the positive is football and well, it is bourbon season. Being so busy this time of year has prevented me from my favorite past time ‚Äì holing up in the B&V labs and scribbling about the music that shaped my life. I‚Äôm long overdue for a post, but enough about me. I got home from one of my interminable business trips this Friday, dropped my suitcases in an exhausted heap and learned that the Rock Chick had bought us tickets to see the new bio-pic about Freddy Mercury and Queen, ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody.‚Äù This was quite a delightful surprise. She was not keen to go see this movie. Earlier in the week, there had been an intense negotiation around which flicks we would be seeing in the near term. In exchange for her going to ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody,‚Äô I fear I may have committed to go to ‚ÄòA Star Is Born.‚Äô Say what you want about Lady Gaga, (and while I think she‚Äôs talented, I‚Äôm not a fan‚Ä¶not my style), Kris Kristofferson and Streisand own that movie for me‚Ä¶ Little known fact, Streisand originally asked Elvis to play the part of the druggy, burned-out rock star‚Ä¶ He (or more likely, the Colonel) turned her down. They speculate that taking the role could have saved his life. He‚Äôd have had to sober up and get in shape. At least Baabs tried. What might have been‚Ä¶? Last night, I finally got to do something other than work and we went to see ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody.‚Äô The movie stars Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury, Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor, Joseph Mazzello as John Deacon (or Deacon John as we knew him back in the day), and finally Gwilym Lee as Brian May. Gwilym? This kid‚Äôs parents must have been hippies or had a strange sense of humor. Not enough can be said about the performance of Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin, Freddy‚Äôs long time friend and briefly, his wife. I will be the first to admit, this movie is flawed. The timeline as to which songs or which albums were released was way off. Probably only an OCD rock fan with a blog would notice but I kept muttering about it to the Rock Chick. I think Freddy was probably a tortured soul and struggled with his own ‚Äúduality of nature‚Äù if you will, and I think Rami Malek captures that well. However, I think there was a lot of joy in Freddy‚Äôs life and I don‚Äôt think they captured enough of that. Freddy always looked like he was having a great time to me. All of that aside, as a rock fan, I really liked this movie. But then, I really love Queen. Queen were already international rock stars when my own rock and roll awakening took place in 7th or 8th grade. My parents weren‚Äôt musical, they never played the radio, but somehow there were just certain songs or groups that seemed to pierce my consciousness. I can distinctly remember going to the pool in the summer, which was literally my only exposure to pop music when I was a kid (except those rare times I went into my brother‚Äôs room, he was far more advanced musically than I was), and being aware of hearing ‚ÄúRhiannon‚Äù by Fleetwood Mac and ‚ÄúKiller Queen‚Äù by, of course, Queen. I was literally aware of Queen before I was aware of rock and roll. My first vinyl Queen purchase was 1977‚ÄôsNews Of The World.It was one of the first rock albums I‚Äôd purchased. You couldn‚Äôt get away from the lead singles ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You/We Are the Champions.‚Äù The ‚ÄúChampions‚Äù part was Freddy‚Äôs snarky reply to the punks, and probably the best reply by a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù rock band other than ‚ÄúWho Are¬† You?‚Äù Who would have dreamed a band fronted by a gay man would pen a song that would be played in every arena and stadium at every macho sporting event for the rest of recorded time. I simply loved that album. It had a little bit of everything. People forget that Queen started as a hard rock band with prog rock influences. While they rocked, they could certainly roll too. Freddy, very early on, cited Robert Plant as a singing idol. Metallica has covered some of their early stuff‚Ä¶News Of the Worldhad plenty of hard rock (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Late‚Äù is my perennial favorite), but it also had piano ballads (‚ÄúMy Melancholy Blues‚Äù), disco (‚ÄúGet Down Make Love‚Äù) and epic arena rock (‚ÄúSpread Your Wings‚Äù). AfterNews,I was on the bandwagon. Queen was on top of the world at that time. 1978‚ÄôsJazzwhich was described in Rolling Stone magazine as ‚Äúfascist,‚Äù and had nothing to do with the musical genre it‚Äôs named after. It was all rock and roll. That was followed by their oft overlooked live album,Live Killersthat always seemed to be playing at keg parties I went to. It was always that album and Rush‚Äôs2112that somebody put on. Queen finally reached their second career zenith (the first being, of course, their masterpiece,A Night At the Opera)with 1980‚ÄôsThe Game.The lead single was ‚ÄúCrazy Little Thing Called Love‚Äù and it still knocks me out. I was too young to realize that Freddy was doing Elvis. The Gamealways conjures a bit of a bittersweet reaction in me. Queen came to Kansas City on that tour. My friend Matthew and his hot girlfriend Debbie tried to talk me into going to the show. By then, I was a ‚ÄúDeath Before Disco‚Äù guy and didn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúAnother One Bites the Dust.‚Äù I hate to admit it, but I think there was more to it than that. ForThe GameFreddy had cut his hair short, grown a mustache and was dressed like a butch biker. All the time we‚Äôd been listening to Queen, we‚Äôd all say, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not gay, he‚Äôs just English, they‚Äôre more flamboyant,‚Äù with all apologies to every Englishmen out there. I fear I was part of the backlash against Queen and I didn‚Äôt go the show. I wish I‚Äôd seen these guys, I blew it. My friend Matthew sadly passed out as they came on stage and only regained consciousness when they were saying goodnight. I think we‚Äôve all had nights like that‚Ä¶mine was Neil Young and Crazy Horse‚Ä¶ what happened? It was then that Queen began to ‚Äúlose‚Äù America. Their next album,Hot Spacewas their worst‚Ä¶ I shudder when I think about the lead single, ‚ÄúBody Language.‚Äù Not even the presence of David Bowie and ‚ÄúUnder Pressure‚Äù could save that record. There was more to it ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know if it was gay backlash. I know at the time ofThe GameI was an adolescent kid who didn‚Äôt know much about the world. I was still forming. An in your face gay Freddy was more than we could handle. I‚Äôm ashamed of that now. Now I‚Äôd say it doesn‚Äôt matter who you‚Äôre fucking, what matters is the music‚Ä¶ Despite all that, we all still made sure we were home when Queen were on Saturday Night Live. I can still remember being thrilled to see them perform ‚ÄúCrazy Little Thing Called Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnder Pressure.‚Äù That was back when SNL was ‚Äúappointment‚Äù television. You‚Äôd make sure to get home to see the skits, and more importantly for me, the bands. While it wasn‚Äôt until much later that I picked up 1984‚ÄôsThe Works,I certainly got back on the bandwagon for their album,A Kind of Magic,which was basically the soundtrack to one of my all time favorite movies, ‚ÄòHighlander.‚Äô I can remember Matthew saying at the time, ‚ÄúBrian May needs to take control of this band,‚Äù which probably shows our lack of understanding as to how Queen operated. Queen went on to have a very strong late career. The highlight of which, and the climactic moment in ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody,‚Äô was their performance at Live Aid. I remember watching them on TV and being blown away. Forget all the reunions ‚Äì Zeppelin, CSNY, Mick and Tina Turner, Black Sabbath ‚Äì Queen stole the show. The final scene in the movie, which is a spot-on recreation of Queen‚Äôs Live Aid set (slightly edited) put tears in my eyes. When I got home from the theater I had to pull up the YouTube video and marveled at how kick ass Queen was that day. Mercury was warned by doctors he could lose his voice if he sang that day, and he still went on. The fans at Wembley went certifiably nuts‚Ä¶ As I watched the YouTube footage, again, tears welled for a friend lost too early, Freddy Mercury. Fans of rock and roll, fans of Queen, fans of the human experience, the ‚Äúduality of nature, human nature‚Ä¶‚Äù, all of you should go and see this movie. It‚Äôs not a perfect biography but it was a fun and enjoyable movie. The thing that you‚Äôll enjoy the most is the power and majesty of the rock and roll Queen and Freddy made. It‚Äôs certainly better than that mess Oliver Stone made about the Doors. After you‚Äôve seen it, run home and dropSheer Heart Attackon the turntable, pour something dark and murky and marvel‚Ä¶ Long Live the Queen!  Nice review ‚Äì been trying to convince my wife to see it ‚Äì and I went with her to see Star is Born üòÄ. I heard an interview with Brian May once on NPR Fresh Air where he sounded pretty bitter about the way Queen and Freddie were treated in the US. Back then of course radio was more important for getting your songs exposed and many rock stations would t play them.

      "[[Daddy Issues | By Morgan Y. Evans Anyone who reads this will realize in short order that Daddy Issues ought to be the new leaders of society. The Greensboro, NC band play a superfun blend of power pop, indie and bad girl slow jams that will melt your heart and stir your coffee. I found them on line and fell in love with them all without telling them. Clearly these are rock goddesses. Once I mustered the fortitude to talk to them, the band was wonderful enough to answer my pathetic questions about their current activities. So Hard by Daddy Issues How are you today? What is going on in the current world of Daddy Issues? Lindsey: We‚Äôre good! We just recorded an EP this summer and released the first single last week. It‚Äôs calledSo Hard. Lauren: It‚Äôs about boners. Lindsey: We‚Äôre also working on learning some Queen covers for this fundraiser show for Planned Parenthood in September. Basically we‚Äôre channeling Freddie Mercury and singing about boners. Do you cite a lot of the same influences? The songwriting is really concise and melodies on point. Lindsey: Thank you! Actually we don‚Äôt really. Lauren: Hannah is obsessed with Ty Segall, Lindsey only listens to weird old garage comps, I listen to French yeh-yeh pop and old doo wop, and Maddie‚Äôs into punk and doom metal. Maddie: Also early American folk music. And noise rock. Lindsey: But when we‚Äôre at karaoke we sing Tammy Wynette and Fleetwood Mac. Maybe your true influences are reflected in your karaoke choices? Yes. Mine are Prince and Bon Jovi. Post 9/11 I used to get free beers singing ‚ÄúWanted Dead Or Alive‚Äù dedicated to Bin Laden at Irish bars. So, What do you love about being a band from your state? Lindsey: Greensboro specifically is really cool because it‚Äôs not expensive to live here, there‚Äôs a small DIY scene, and we‚Äôre an hour away from the triangle (Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Durham), which has about a million good bands and nice people. Hannah: Like Silent Lunch. And T0W3RS. Lindsey: And See Gulls. Maddie: And Pie Face Girls. Lauren: And Free Clinic from Wilmington. Lindsey: There‚Äôs a ton of musical history in North Carolina, too. I mean, Link Wray is from a town two hours away from us. And you have Merge Records and Yep Roc, and now Phuzz Records all based in NC. Things are terrible politically in North Carolina, but musically it feels like something really special is happening here. What are your plans for the rest of 2014? Maddie: Make a really sweet Halloween costume. Lauren: I think Morgan means in terms of the band. Maddie: Oh, okay, then I want to write some sick bass lines. Hannah: I just wanna be present. My plan is to find the perfect taco. Lauren: Get into med school. Lindsey: Lauren‚Äôs serious. She‚Äôs studying pre-med. And she already has degrees in English and French. Hannah‚Äôs also planning on watching 60 horror films before Halloween. We watched Hellraiser the other night and some weird 60s Italian movie where everyone was getting murdered on this island but the soundtrack was this super relaxed, pleasant lounge music. That was probably the scariest part. In terms of the band, I‚Äôd love to get our EP out on a 7‚Äù and plan a spring tour.  You could combine these interests and make pre-med horror nurse costumes. I think fans would be stoked. Not to sound crass, but do you ever get hormonal at the same time and does it make you crabby towards one another or instead, bursting with manic energy? Hannah: When you‚Äôre in a band with all dudes and you all get horny at the same time, do you like to circle jerk? (boo ya üôÇ Um, yes. Please name a moment that made you believe that rock n roll was important to you. Hannah: In high school, my friend Jenny and I would listen to Velvet Underground and Led Zeppelin and re-write the words to make them like personal rock love poems. It was probably the only way we knew how to talk about what we were feeling. Lauren: When I was 5, I saw Ziggy Stardust on VH1. I was hypnotized, not just by the music but by his whole performance/persona. Maddie: The first time I ever listened to Black Flag. Lindsey: Maddie‚Äôs such a badass. I have all these stories about sitting on the school bus or riding in the car as a kid and crying because an awesome song came on the radio. It happened a lot. I‚Äôm sensitive. I remember the first time I heard Wild Horses, I was in my Mom‚Äôs car in California and just broke down and started crying. I was like 6. You can‚Äôt process or explain feelings like that, they just overwhelm you and make you realize something is important. Like Reo Speedwagon. I know. So, have you heard the wuss from Twilight might be the new Indiana Jones! what is he gonna sparkle his way out of the Temple of Doom? I can‚Äôt even imagine that guy successfully navigating a girly drink let along Nazis. Lindsey: Dude just don‚Äôt watch any Indiana Jones movies that came out after the 80s and everything will be okay. Watch them while drinking some sort of fruity rum thing! A sex on the beach. Trust me. How often do you get together to play or even hang out when not rehearsing? Hannah: I am constantly with these bitches. I can‚Äôt get them off my dick. Maddie: Wait, what do you mean? There are bands that get alone time? Lauren: When we‚Äôre not practicing we‚Äôre watching Clueless and feeding each other grapes. Jesus. What would you say if I said I maybe want to have an action figure of each of you and fight with my friends over who is coolest, cutest, smartest, most likely to be a gypsy, etc? Lauren: If there were an action figure of us, it would be like a four-headed Amazonian warrior monster. Maddie: With red hair. Hannah: And great teeth. Lauren: That always wore big earrings. Lindsey: And doc martens. And a bone necklace. Hannah: And its superpower would be super nuclear farts like in Tremors III. Lauren: Wait that really happens in Tremors III? Hannah: Yeah. They‚Äôre called ass blasters. They propel themselves by farting. Lindsey: Morgan we would totally give you one of these action figures, except probably no one in the world would want one. daddyissuesnc.bandcamp.comwww.facebook.com/daddy.issues111 You must belogged into post a comment.

      "[[I did this retrospective with one of my teams recently, and seeing as the feedback afterwards was really positive, I thought I would share. First off, kudos toThe Virtual Agile Coachfor creating this retrospective in the first place. I don‚Äôt have a paid Miro account so had to recreate the experience in Powerpoint (file attached), but he had done the heavy lifting and Miro templates are available on his amazing site for those with the power to import. Some context to add is that I have had some push-back from the team in the past when it came to activities in meetings that they did not regard as ‚Äúwork‚Äù. For example, some people don‚Äôt like random check-ins while others complain when we have to interact with a visual aid (‚Äúcan‚Äôt we just talk?‚Äù). As an experiment, for this retrospective, I explained the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each of the facilitation activities I was using. And I believe it helped üôÇ Another note is that although I have indicated the timeboxes I used, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that this was a fairly large group (14 people) which brings its own challenges. For example, if you have a smaller team, then potentially break-out rooms would not be necessary. First I shared the Miro board link in the chat (I had already shared it before the session, but wanted to make sure everyone could get there) while we were waiting for people to join. Then we started with an activity. I pasted the following instruction in the chat:  We usedhttps://wheeldecide.com/(which I had set up with the team names and to remove an entry after each spin) to decide the order for people to share in. I also gave the instructions verbally. Before we started, I explained why we were doing the activity:‚ÄúWhen a person doesn‚Äôt speak at the beginning of a meeting, that person has tacit permission to remain silent for the rest of the session (and often will). We want to ensure that no one has a subconscious barrier to speaking up in our retrospective because it is important that everyone feels able to contribute equally.‚Äù Remember to pause before you spin the wheel for the first time so people have a chance to think about what they will answer. After the ‚Äúfruit‚Äù check-in, we went to the Miro board and I reminded everyone why we did retrospectives (The Agile Principle) and the mindset we were meant to have during the discussion (The Prime Directive). I also ran through the agenda. I pasted the next instruction into the chat before I started speaking (it included a link to the correct Miro frame):  I explained why we were doing silent writing:‚ÄúSome people need time to stop and think or are not able to think while other people are talking. We‚Äôd like to give those people a chance to gather their thoughts before we move into a stage where we want them to listen to the ‚Äúspeak to think‚Äù people in the room. Another reason we‚Äôre doing silent writing is it is easier for the human brain to stay engaged and focused when we engage at least two of our senses. So in this instance people are seeing and typing (movement). And having a whiteboard in general means you can capture notes (movement) and listen at the same time. Another reason it‚Äôs good to capture notes is sometimes people might have to step away, or will be briefly distracted, and then there is a visual representation of what they might have missed and they can catch up with the rest of the group. We also have some team members who cannot be here today, and this creates something they can refer to when they are back at work. Lastly, our brains can only hold 5-8 items at any one time, so by writing down our thoughts before we move into conversation, it means we can focus on listening rather than trying to remember what we want to say.‚Äù I then reiterated the instruction and played the song ‚ÄúAnother One Bites the Dust‚Äù while they performed the activity (because the length of the song is almost 4 minutes). Once again, I started with pasting the instructions (the same link as for silent writing) into the chat:  I explained that we would be going into break-out rooms of 3-4 people randomly assigned by Zoom and that each group would have about five minutes to discuss what they could see on the board plus add any new thoughts out of the discussion. I explained why we were using breakout rooms:‚ÄúWe want everyone to have a chance to speak, and because we are so many people, to do so in one group would take a long time. Breaking up into smaller groups means we can have some of those conversations in parallel. It‚Äôs also easier for people to connect online when they are in a smaller group and our brains find smaller groups less tiring, particularly when using a tool like Zoom.‚Äù I then repeated the instructions and sent everyone into break-out rooms. Once everyone was back, I added the next instruction to the chat (with a new link to the relevant frame on Miro):  I then told the group we would be going into break-out rooms again (this time with new people) and this time the idea was to step back and look for patterns or trends. To try see things from a new/different perspective. I mentioned that the instructions were in the chat and that there was a space on the Miro board to add notes (if they wanted to). I also said that we would be having a debrief of what was discussed as a single group when everyone came back from the break-out rooms. Before I opened the new rooms, I checked in as to whether the first break-out slot had been long enough. One group mentioned that they hadn‚Äôt really managed to get to everything so, as we were running ahead of schedule, I added an extra two minutes to the five-minute break-out room timebox. While people were in the break-out rooms, I added a funny hat to my Zoom attire. When everyone had returned from the break-out rooms, we made time for discussions. This is where, as a facilitator, you need to be prepared for awkward silences! Once the first group had had their turn, things flowed again. I was ready to add any additional comments/notes that came out of the debrief however, in this instance, there were none. The chat instruction:  I explained that we had gathered data and highlighted any trends or observations, and now we had to decide what we wanted to try in our next sprint. The first part of that process was to capture and share our ideas. We would do this by having five minutes of silent writing, followed by a 10 minute break, and when we returned after our break we would discuss the ideas on the board. I told the team that I would be playing music for the silent-writing part, however people could use the time as they chose, as long as they had captured their ideas by the time we returned from our break. After checking for any questions, I started playing the song: ‚ÄúI want it all‚Äú. While the song was playing, I kept my camera on as a visible indication that the break hadn‚Äôt officially started. When the song finished playing, I turned my camera and microphone off (we generally stay in the Zoom room for breaks) and re-iterated in the chat window what time everyone was expected to be back. I changed my Zoom hat again for the final part of the session, and reminded the team that we were aiming to shape our ideas into at least one action or first step that we wanted to try in our next sprint. We started with a debrief of the ideas that had been added to the board, particularly the ones that were not so specific and more like thinking items (so that we could generate some specific ideas for what we could try). Once we were done discussing, we usedMentito rank vote the actions we‚Äôd come up with. One could also use something like dot voting. I used Menti because my team are familiar with Menti and I find it‚Äôs quicker to update ‚Äòjust in time‚Äô. As an aside, before we rank vote, we also usually get the team‚Äôs input as to the impact/effort for each of the proposed actions. For this session, it actually led to further discussion, because one team member realised that they didn‚Äôt know enough about the action to be able to rate the effort to do it. Once ranked, we took the top ranked action and ensured that it wasSMART. At that point we were out of time, so I asked the team if we were OK to end the session. Sometimes in the past we have decided to take more than one action into our sprint (but we try limit it to no more than three). We also always do afist-to-fiveto ensure everyone can live with the SMART action(s) as described. I like to use a Zoom poll for this. To close the session, I re-capped what we had done during the session (starting with the check-in activity) and that we had agreed to one action for the next sprint. I reminded people who had specific actions from our discussions about their tasks. Finally, I asked the team if they would give me feedback on Miro by And, with that, we thanked each other and ended our sprint retrospective. If you give a similar retrospective a try, let me know how it goes. I would be interested what did and did not work for you and your team.   Œî]]\n",

      "[[The DV Walking Wounded: ‚úù The Spiritual & Mental Health \"Breaking Free\" Blog: For DV & Sexual Abuse Survivors üíü As a teen, I saw Freddie Mercury and Queen on LiveAid and haven‚Äôt been the same since. He had total command of the crowd. What gave me goosebumps was watching theBohemian Rhapsodymovie and remembering stopping in my tracks and getting goosebumps inthatmoment. I highly recommend that movie! The actor playing Freddie, Rami Malek, looks justlikehim and has the same mannerisms. It‚Äôs like Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison all over again! Music and movies go hand in hand! If you‚Äôve ever belted outBohemian Rhapsodyat the top of your lungs or felt chills duringSomebody to Love, you know there‚Äôs something truly magical about Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice. But what exactly made his voice so captivating? Scientists decided to find out, and their findings are as fascinating as the legendary Queen frontman himself. In 2016, a team of Austrian, Czech, and Swedish researchers delved deep into the science behind Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice. They analyzed recordings of his singing and speaking, studied his vibrato, and even had a professional rock singer mimic his style to get a closer look at the vocal mechanics involved. Here‚Äôs what they discovered: Freddie Mercury‚Äôs vocal range was impressive. While most rock singers typically span about two octaves, Mercury could comfortably cover three octaves. This wasn‚Äôt just a natural gift; it was the result of his exceptional vocal control and technique. He could switch from a deep, throaty growl to a soaring, operatic high note with ease, making his performances incredibly dynamic and expressive. One of the standout features of Mercury‚Äôs voice was his vibrato ‚Äì the slight, rapid variation in pitch that adds richness to a note. While a typical vibrato frequency is around 5.4 Hz, Freddie‚Äôs vibrato averaged 7.0 Hz. This faster vibrato gave his voice a unique texture and contributed to its powerful, resonant quality. Perhaps the most intriguing finding was Mercury‚Äôs use of subharmonics. These are additional tones that are produced below the main note being sung, creating a fuller, more resonant sound. This technique is rare and requires exceptional control of the vocal cords. It‚Äôs part of what made his voice sound so rich and full, even at higher pitches. Freddie Mercury was a musical chameleon. He seamlessly blended the raw, powerful edge of rock with the refined, technical precision of opera. This fusion was evident in songs like ‚ÄúBarcelona,‚Äù his collaboration with opera singer Montserrat Caball√©, where he showcased his ability to perform in both styles with equal brilliance. His versatility and willingness to experiment with different genres set him apart from other rock vocalists of his time. While the scientific analysis provides a fascinating insight into the technical aspects of Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice, it‚Äôs essential to remember that his true magic lay in his ability to connect with audiences on an emotional level. His performances were not just about hitting the right notes but about conveying passion, vulnerability, and sheer joy. Whether he was singing about love, heartbreak, or the sheer thrill of life, Mercury had a way of making you feel every word. Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice continues to inspire and captivate music lovers around the world. The scientific study offers a glimpse into the extraordinary mechanics behind his vocal prowess, but it also reinforces what fans have always known ‚Äì Freddie Mercury was a one-of-a-kind talent whose voice was as unique as his spirit. So, the next time you find yourself singing along to a Queen classic, take a moment to appreciate the incredible artistry and technique that went into creating those unforgettable sounds. Freddie Mercury‚Äôs voice was more than just a gift; it was a testament to the power of music to move and inspire us all. On another similar ‚Äúnote‚Äù (see what I did there!?!) I copied this from a Facebook post, but DID verify its validity first: Science has established thatDon‚Äôt Stop Me Nowby Queen is the song that can make you feel better. Don‚Äôt Stop Me Nowby Queen wins first place in the ranking of songs that have a positive impact on mood. According to a study conducted by cognitive neuroscientist Jacob Jolij of the University of Groningen, this famous track is the most encouraging in the world. The research, commissioned by a well-known electronics brand, analyzed various factors, including the beats per minute, the key and the chords of the song. According to Jolij, combining these elements gives the formula for the perfect ‚Äòfeel-good song‚Äô. Here are the top 10 songs that put you in a good mood according to the study: Rock on, especially with Dr Freddie Mercury! <3 I‚Äôve always loved Queen. One of my favorite bands as a child, and one I returned to throughout my life. Iconic, really. And Freddie Mercury is an icon in so many ways and had so much he offered the world through his gifts. Thanks for responding. Sadly, Freddie left this Earth too soon! Freddie Mercury was a really gifted singer. I just listened to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now,‚Äù and it made me feel excited and enthusiastic and ready to be the best me I could possibly be. Isn‚Äôt it amazing how good music makes you feel!

Freddy Mercury joined the band \"The Hectics\" in 1962, with whom he performed in smaller clubs. In 1963 he met Brian May and Roger Taylor, who later became the members of his world-famous band Queen. Queen was formed in 1970 and had its first performance at the London Music Hall. The band quickly found success and released their first album in 1974. Their second album \"Queen II\" was released a year later and brought them their international breakthrough. In 1975, the album \"A Night at the Opera\" was released, which included the world-famous song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The song became a world hit and helped the band achieve worldwide fame. In the following years, Queen released other successful albums such as \"News of the World\" (1977), \"Jazz\" (1978) and \"The Game\" (1980). In 1981 the band participated in the concerts for Live Aid, which went down in music history as one of the greatest rock events of all time. Queen continued to play successfully until the end of the 1980s, when Freddy Mercury became seriously infected with the AIDS virus. However, he did not publicly announce his illness until he was already in the final stages. Freddy Mercury died on November 24, 1991 at the age of 45 as a result of AIDS. His last words are said to have been, \"I'm proud to be a part of Queen.\" Gallery]]\n",

Ways of knowing and explanations for how things got to be the way they are! Et cetera!)--we started calling this cluster ‚Äúreligion‚Äù precisely AS we started having things like nation-states, and those nation-states started using this cluster to explain why they could and should and would take over the territory and resources and humans of other regions. And boy howdy do we see imperialism in action when we‚Äôre talking about Zoroastrianism. As we‚Äôve been saying for what feels like forever, religion is imperial. And Zoroastrianism is one of the ways people do religion in the world (duh). So learning more about Zoroastrianism makes you more religiously literate. This is a small tradition compared to, say, Buddhism, but it‚Äôs still internally diverse and deeply interesting. Since most folks do not know what Zoroastrianism is, we started at the beginning. Zoroastrianism is an ancient Persian monotheistic religion and is possibly/probably the world‚Äôs oldest monotheism. Most of the world‚Äôs Zoroastrians live in India (and also Iran). I know Zoroastrians in India also call themselvesParsis. In fact, in India they call themselves (and are called) Parsis because they‚Äôre Persian ‚Äî Parsi basicallymeansPersian, and Pars (or Fars) is a region of Iran still today. Also, because imperialism is important, you should know practitioners of this tradition did not start out calling themselves Zoroastrians. The tradition was founded by a man named Zoroaster or Zarathustra and ‚Äì surprise, surprise ‚Äì when European colonizers showed up in India, they asked about founders and holy books and then started calling this community after the name of its founder. Thus: Zoroastrianism in textbooks, Parsis for many community members, and other names for self in other periods. Zoroastrianism is often summed up by:good thoughts, good words,andgood deeds.   This effort is reflected in a symbol called thefaravahar‚Äì this example works really well in an audio medium, obvs, but picture a big beardy dude with huge three tiered wings, facing to the left. The three tiers of his left-hand wings represent good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; the tiers on the right-hand wings represent bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds. Zoroastrians are supposed to turn toward the good and away from the bad; some Zoroastrians wear the faravahar as a reminder for them to do just that. Even though it‚Äôs comparatively small, with something like 200,000 practitioners worldwide, Zoroastrianism isstillvery much aglobal religion! There are Zoroastrians all over the world‚Äîand Zoroastrianism is shaped by its global spread, sometimes under explicit religious persecution, other times based on broader, European imperialist distaste for their colonized subjects, and other times because of how people move about in modernity. Most Zoroastrians live in India and Iran, as we said above, but there are also Zoroastrian communities in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, the UK, Australia, Zanzibar, Kenya, New Zealand, and the USA. So, in short: small religion by population, not by global spread, and some of that we live everywhere thing is about, you guessed it, colonialism. Kainaz Amariajoined us to share her experiences as a Fulbright scholar documenting the Zoroastrian community in India, her experiences as a member of this small-but-global community, and her approach to religions visually. Ms. Amaria isVox‚Äôs Visual Editor,formerly an editor for NPR‚Äôs Visual Team, and before that she was a freelance photographer in Mumbai for outlets like theNew York Times, Vogue India, andReuters.  Meganwanted us to remember that Zoroastrians are still Zoroastrianing! When this community makes the news, the story is usually about the people and the religion supposedly dying out. But Zoroastrianism is NOT dying out ‚Äì it‚Äôs just changing, because the communities who do Zoroastrianism are changing. Ilysewanted us to remember colonialism, and why the patterns of movement ‚Äî like Freddie Mercury‚Äôs own family! ‚Äî reflect colonial violence. Ilysetalked to us a lot about Freddie Mercury, much beloved late lead singer of Queen, who is (arguably) the world‚Äôs most recognizable Zoroastrian/Parsi. Megancheated and gave us two factoids this week. She‚Äôs unstoppable. First, Megan shared with us the relationship between India‚Äôs PM Modi and Parsis being held up as a model minority within his (very Hindu nationalist) government. Second she shared a deeply embarrassing and problematic memory of our cherished guest, Kainaz Amaria, who happened to be Megan‚Äôs college roommate for a minute. And this is a story of Megan‚Äôs tragic love of Kipling meeting an actual-factual person of South Asian descent. Shenanigans ensue. Work has been done to repair and reflect. Meganwants us to check outKainaz Amaria‚Äôs recent work on the website for Vox, where she is the Visual Editor. She‚Äôs done some really striking photography-driven political reporting; I‚Äôve especially appreciated her voice and insights on how racism and exploitative images of human suffering inform reporting on people of color particularly in times of crisis. We‚Äôll link to her Vox page in the shownotes, but listeners might be especially interested inthe piece she did with Sigal Samuel (former religion editor at Atlantic, now senior reporter at Vox) on 45‚Äôs praising India for religious freedom while anti-Muslim violence was erupting in February 2020. Ms. Amaria also curated a fascinating (and deeply upsetting) gallery of images from the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem in 2018,which can be found here. The must-watch piece of Ms. Amaria‚Äôs work is the short film she produced as a Fulbright scholar in Mumbai in 2010. It‚Äôs called‚ÄúBeing Zoroastrian,‚Äùruns about 10 minutes, and provides complex personal and community insights into contemporary Parsi belonging. Beyond Ms. Amaria‚Äôs work, check out: A piece from Middle East Eye about the Zoroastrian priestesses of Iran,available here Megan likes to juxtapose the pieceShaun Walker wrote forthe Guardiancalled ‚ÄúThe Last of the Zoroastrians‚ÄùwithAmy dePaul‚Äôs ‚ÄúZoroastrianism Rises in North America‚Äù forWSJ. Megan also did abig lecture thread on Zoroastrianismwhen she was teaching Global Religions remotely. While prepping for this episode, Megan found a cool item about ancient Zoroastrian texts being found in China, written by Ursula Sims-Williams, who is Curator of Iranian languages at the British Library and thus, I assume, knows whereof she writes.Check it out. And lastly and perhaps most randomly,Dave Malloy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoby Dick: A Musical Reckoning,‚Äùincludes a fourth-wall break moment where a character does a real quick compare and contrast between Zoroastrianism and Islam.  Ilysealso assigned things! Mahnaz Moazami,Zoroastrianism : A Collection of Articles from the Encyclopaedia Iranica.2016. Mitra Sharafi,Law and Identity in Colonial South Asia: Parsi Legal Culture, 1772‚Äì1947(Studies in Legal History) New Books Network podcast with Sharafi! Jenny Rose has some great stuff. She has two intros, one more academic and the other more for mass audiences: Zoroastrianism: An Introduction(I.B. Tauris, 2011) ‚Äã‚Äã Zoroastrianism: A Guide for the Perplexed(Continuum, 2011) But the one Ilyse likes best because colonialism and intellectual history is:The Image of Zoroaster: The Persian Mage Through European Eyes(Bibliotheca Persica Press, 2000) For YA with a dash of angst about belonging, queerness, and the background noise of being Zoroastrian:Darius the Great Is Not Okayby Adib Khorram and its sequel,Darius the Great Deserves Better Ilyse couldn‚Äôt leave Queen out of her recs. Freddie Mercury, aka Farrokh Bulsara, whose own life‚Äìof Parsi-Indian descent but born in Zanzibar, who later Anglicizes his name for all the reasons‚Äìshows the colonialism & violence inherent in the system. Go listen wherever you get music, since no one consumes albums as wholes anymore, says this millennial, I guess. But if you do,QueenandJazzandA Night at the Operaare places to start.

Few bands embodied the pure excess of the '70s like Freddy Mercury and Queen. Embracing the exaggerated pomp of progressive rock and heavy metal, as well as vaudevillian music hall, the British quartet delved deeply into camp and bombast, creating a huge, mock-operatic sound with layered guitars and overdubbed vocals. Mercury's voice was a bizarre yet highly accessible fusion of the macho and the fey. For years, Queens albums boasted the motto \"no synthesizers were used on this record,\" signaling their allegiance with the legions of post-Led Zeppelin hard rock bands. Tribute to Frewddy Mercury is an exclusive album for all collectors. 1. We Will Rock You2. Flash - Queen3. Love Of My Life4. Under Pressure5. Don't stop me now6. Killer queen7. I want it all8.

      "[[New Patients: (954) 939-0996 Existing Patients: (954) 581-0120 Aug Ok, like everyone else, COVID social distancing has ‚Äòforced‚Äô me to catch up on a really long list of must watch TV and movies. Top of that list for me was ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody‚Äô. I know, I know‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like two years old, but it‚Äôs free on HBO so maybe some of you will find a new, or renewed interest in the topic. As a dentist I was blown away by Freddy‚Äôs explanation of what gave him such an amazing voice. To my amazement, he attributed his 4 octave range to having 4 extra incisors. He believed that gave him a larger palate and improved resonance. Now, I can‚Äôt carry a tune in a bucket, so I have no idea of what the power of resonance can do for a singer, but I am a scientist, and a dentist, and I know a thing or two about teeth and mouths. Reports of what Freddy‚Äôs actual dental condition was, aren‚Äôt consistent. Even as a dental ‚Äòinsider‚Äô, I can‚Äôt just summon his X-rays to come up with a diagnosis. But, we can be reasonably certain that based on his account, he had a condition called mesiodens ‚Äì or extra front teeth. Specifically extra central incisors, and studies show that up to 2% of the population have this condition. It‚Äôs called supernumerary teeth (which can happen anywhere in the mouth), and it affects men 2x more than women. (1,2) Mesiodens usually presents as a single extra tooth, but Freddy reports having had 4 extras. Needless to say that would be extremely rare and unique. Supernumerary teeth usually need to be surgically removed, because they‚Äôre usually impacted and can alter the normal path of eruption of the permanent teeth. Likely what happened in Freddy‚Äôs case. Reports are consistent though about Freddy being very self conscious of the appearance of his smile. As a kid he had the unfortunate nickname ‚ÄòBucky‚Äô, which, of course, he hated. The complex was in part responsible for his iconic mustache, used to cover his obvious underbite. Much to his credit, even though he felt the way he did about his teeth, he never got them fixed because he feared it would limit his ability to sing. While he credited the extra teeth for changing the shape of his mouth and allowing for better vocals, some very interesting research out of the UK suggests otherwise. Turns out his gifted vocal range was likely due to his uncanny ability to use a larger part of his vocal cords than most of us do. When he sang, he was able to recruit a part of his larynx called ‚Äòfalse vocal cords‚Äô or vestibular folds (3). Some people have the unique ability to utilize these structures (they even had someone swallow a camera to see it happen in action) ‚Äì allowing for that distinctive low end growl to reach soaring tonal heights in just a stanza. Either way, regardless of what made him such a unique musical figure, I don‚Äôt care. Freddy Mercury lived as a true performer, touching the lives of millions, and always pushing the envelope. I‚Äôm lucky to have been a fan, still am, and always will be. The show will go on.
